We are a computational biology research group in [SIPBS](Strathclyde Institute for Pharmacy and Biomedical Sciences) at the University of Strathclyde, Glasgow. We apply computational and mathematical approaches to better understand biology.

Our main areas of research are in microbiology, human health, and plant health, We have experience and work across a number of areas, including:

- genomics
- systems biology
- metabolic modelling
- software development
- biostatistics
- phylogenetics and phylogenomics
