Grounded in classrooms. Curious about systems. Learning across borders.

After a Masterâ€™s in Social and Cultural Anthropology and three years in a PhD program, I took a detour into small business, programming, and eventually, education.


Those years taught me how to work hard, think independently, and stay curious across disciplines. When I returned to the classroom, first as a substitute, then full-time while completing my teaching degree, it felt like all those paths had quietly prepared me to teach with context and care.

I now teach English at a Flemish secondary school, and once a week in the evening, I also teach adults at a CVO. Switching between teenagers and adults keeps me alert to what learners actually need, and how they change. My teaching sits at the intersection of language, culture, and inclusion, and I'm particularly interested in how cross-border educational collaboration can strengthen equity, multilingualism, and lifelong learning across Europe.

I recently joined [EVROPA magazine](https://medium.com/evropa) as a contributing writer, where I explore the links between pedagogy, migration, and European education.

**I share reflections and resources here, and document my journey through teaching and international collaboration. Find me on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/nikkie.badsar/) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nikkie-badsar/).**
