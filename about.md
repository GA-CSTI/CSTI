After a master’s in social and cultural anthropology and three years in a phd program, I took a detour—into small business, programming, and eventually, education.

Those years taught me how to work hard, solve problems independently, and stay curious across disciplines. When I returned to the classroom, first as a substitute, then full-time while completing my teaching degree, it felt like all those paths had quietly prepared me to teach with context and care.

I now teach English at a Flemish secondary school, and once a week in the evening, I also teach adults at a CVO. Switching between teenagers and adults keeps me alert to what learners actually need, and how they change.
I'm especially interested in educational collaboration across Europe and beyond, spaces where teachers can exchange ideas, challenge norms, and build learning cultures that are relevant, multilingual, and human.

**I share reflections and resources here, and document my journey through teaching and international collaboration. Find me on instagram [@nikkie.badsar](https://www.instagram.com/nikkie.badsar/).**
