My Journey Begins: Projects, Learning, and a Career in Finance and Coding

Welcome to my blog! I’m excited to share my journey as I explore the exciting intersection of finance and coding. This space is my personal record of growth—a place where I document the projects I’m building, the courses I’m taking, and the skills I’m developing on my way toward a career that blends technology with the world of finance.

Who I Am and What Drives Me

I’ve always been drawn to the problem-solving power of code and the dynamic, fast-paced nature of the financial markets. Combining these two passions isn’t just a career choice—it’s a vision of how technology can revolutionize finance. Whether it’s automating data analysis or developing trading algorithms, I’m committed to building a strong foundation in coding that will allow me to tackle complex financial challenges.

My Learning Path and Projects

To turn this vision into reality, I’ve enrolled in several courses on Coursera that cover a wide range of topics:

Python and SQL: These courses are helping me master the fundamentals of coding and data manipulation, skills that are essential for any data-driven financial analysis.
Algebra and Fundamental Mathematics: A solid grasp of math is the backbone of understanding algorithms, AI, and financial models.
AI and Finance: By learning how artificial intelligence can be applied in the financial sector, I’m preparing myself for a future where tech and finance converge.
Alongside my coursework, I’m working on projects that allow me to put my learning into practice. My projects include:

Coding Demos: I’m building various projects using different programming languages. I’ll be sharing visual demonstrations—like GIFs and videos—to show you exactly how these projects work.
Finance Projects: I plan to dive into projects that analyze stock market trends, simulate trading strategies, and explore financial data, all while integrating my coding skills.
My Vision for the Future

My ultimate goal is to secure a role in the finance industry in New York—a place where I can apply my coding expertise to real-world financial challenges. I believe that a deep understanding of both technology and finance will open up exciting opportunities, especially in a market as vibrant and competitive as the USA’s.
