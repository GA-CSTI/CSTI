## 02806 â€” Social Data Analysis and Visualization

This project was developed as part of the DTU course **02806 Social Data Analysis and Visualization (2024/2025)**. The course emphasizes building compelling, explanatory visualizations from real-world data using tools like Python, JavaScript, and narrative storytelling frameworks. This is the second assignment to hand in.

The project demonstrates the following key learning objectives from the course:

- Accessing and processing complex online datasets (SF Police Department open data)
- Applying Python for filtering, structuring, and visualizing large temporal-spatial data
- Using Bokeh to design interactive, audience-facing web visualizations
- Interpreting patterns in multi-variable data and presenting them via narrative techniques
- Practicing Tufte's principles of graphical integrity to build effective, informative visuals
- Creating an exploratory and explanatory narrative around crime trends

The result is a **narrative data visualization website** that investigates how crime varies across time, space, and type in San Francisco between 2023 and 2025.
