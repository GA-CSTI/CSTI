  abstract  = "Streptomyces is among the most extensively studied genera of
               bacteria but its complex taxonomy remains contested and is
               suspected to contain significant species-level
               misclassification. Resolving the classification of Streptomyces
               would benefit many areas of applied microbiology that rely on an
               accurate ground truth for grouping of related organisms,
               including comparative genomics-based searches for novel
               antimicrobials. We survey taxonomic conflicts between 16S rRNA
               and whole genome-based Streptomyces classifications using 2276
               publicly available Streptomyces genome assemblies and 48 981
               publicly available full-length 16S rRNA Streptomyces sequences
               from silva, Greengenes, Ribosomal Database Project (RDP), and
               NCBI (National Centre for Biotechnology Information) databases.
               We construct a full-length 16S gene tree for 14 239 distinct
               Streptomyces sequences that resolves three major lineages of
               Streptomyces, but whose topology is not consistent with existing
               taxonomic assignments. We use these sequence data to delineate
               16S and whole genome landscapes for Streptomyces, demonstrating
               that 16S and whole-genome classifications are frequently in
               disagreement, and that 16S zero-radius Operational Taxonomic
               Units (zOTUs) are often inconsistent with Average Nucleotide
               Identity (ANI)-based taxonomy. Our results strongly imply that
               16S rRNA sequence data does not map to taxonomy sufficiently
               well to delineate Streptomyces species routinely. We propose
               that alternative marker sequences should be adopted by the
               community for classification and metabarcoding. Insofar as
               Streptomyces taxonomy has been determined or supported by 16S
               sequence data and may in parts be in error, we also propose that
               reclassification of the genus by alternative approaches may
               benefit the Streptomyces community.",
