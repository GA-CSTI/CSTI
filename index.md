I'm a geophysical fluid dynamicist who is interested in turbulent phenomena. In particular my main
foci are small- and submeso-scale turbulence, which I investigate with a numerical approach (usually
large-eddy simulations). I'm also a big believer in community-driven open-source software as a way
to improve the reproducibility of results in science.

I'm currently working as a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Maryland's Atmospheric and
Oceanic Science department in [Dr. Jacob Wenegrat](https://wenegrat.github.io/)'s group.
