## SIPBS-CompBiol Group Meetings

We hold group meetings each Monday at 2pm, and they typically last for around one hour. If the university is closed on the Monday, we hold the meeting on the Tuesday of that week.

While there are COVID restrictions in place (and it remains convenient) these will be held over Zoom, but the baseline expectation when this ends is to follow university policy: that if you are employed or registered at Strathclyde you should be present in person for these meetings.
