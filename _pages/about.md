Hello! 
thanks for visiting my personal website! 
I am Abhijeet, working as a Data Analyst at SLB (Schlumberger) working primarily on Data Analysis. 

Prior to joining SLB, I graduated from Indian Institute of Technology, Madras with a Bachelors and Masters in Electrical engineering. 
I worked on my final semester project with professor Dr. Balaram Ravindran on option discovery methods for reinforcement learning.
I spend a semester at the Carnegie Mellon University at the Advanced Agents Robotics Technology Lab in 2019-20 for an undergraduate internship.
My areas of interest are Deep learning, Large Language Models and Reinforcement Learning.
