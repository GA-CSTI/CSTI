## Chancellor's Fellow (PI)

Born in Salford, raised in Wigan, educated in Bolton, Leighton started out as a Chemist, earning a degree (BSc (Hons)) in Forensic and Analytical Chemistry from the University of Strathclyde, before realising that wasn't his calling and turning into a computational biologist for his final year project and PhD under the supervision of Mark Dufton, again at Strathclyde, investigating the evolution of snake venome toxins.

After this, Leighton was a PDRA on two Systems Biology projects in Prof. Doug Kell's group in the Institute for Biological Sciences - as it was - at Aberystwyh (_ac mae e'n caru'r iaith Gymraeg, hyd yn oed yn awr_). He spent four years modelling yeast metabolism and rationally engineering proteins, before returning to Scotland to join the James Hutton Institute (until 2011 the Scottish Crop Research Institute) as a computational biologist. There he started working in host-pathogen interactions, microbial genomics, and diagnostics. In the meantime, he earned an Open University degree (BA (Hons)) in Mathematics.

Leighton joined Strathclyde as a Chancellor's Fellow in 2019, just about having enough time to move his textbooks into the office, before the COVID pandemic hit.

Other jobs have included: lots of heaving and hauling, largely in warehouses; product development chemist in the oil industry (where he learned just enough plumbing to get by); and body fluid analysis in a clinical biochemistry lab.
