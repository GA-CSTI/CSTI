## PhD Candidate

I am a UKRI-BBSRC-funded PhD student in Professor Gail Preston's lab.

Bacterial diseases are an increasing threat to both commercial and subsistence crop production. Plant immunity is strongly dependent on environmental factors. Despite this, little is known about the impact of environmental conditions on disease development and severity. In particular, temperature is rarely studied. I study the effects of temperature on Pseudomonas syringae pathogens of common bean, a staple crop worldwide.

I'm especially interested in temperature effects on pathogenicity traits such as oxidative stress response and phytotoxins.
