I've been meaning to start a blog for a while to share some of the tech projects I work on. So far, I've just documented things privately, but I figure it's time to actually publish some of my efforts in the hope of helping someone else.

Once I decided to start a blog, I had to figure out where to host it. I thought about [Wordpress][wordpress] since it was easy, but wanted to try something new. Then I thought about [Medium][medium] since it's the new sexy thing right now, but with the CEO's recent [post][medium-ceo] and the lack of great support for syntax highlighting I thought I better avoid it. So I went with [GitHub pages][gh-pages] for a few reasons:
1. Part of GitHub which is Awesome
2. Force me to learn something new (namely [Jekyll][jekyll-docs])
3. Most of what I want to put on the blog has to do with code or tech things - integration with GitHub is a bonus!

I won't promise to write often or profoundly, but hopefully the things I put here will help some folks working on similar projects.
