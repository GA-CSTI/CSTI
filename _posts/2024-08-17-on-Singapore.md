title: On Singapore
---

As someone with libertarian views who values minimal government intervention and personal freedom, moving to Singapore was an interesting choice. I’ve spent most of my life in the U.S. and Canada, and I’ve lived for at least three months in cities across Latin America, Europe, Africa, Asia, and Oceania. Singapore stood out to me for its unique mix of safety, efficiency, and quality of life. Despite its reputation for strict governance, I’ve found that living in Singapore has given me a sense of freedom I didn’t fully expect.

# 1. Arrival and First Impressions

The experience of arriving in Singapore immediately shows what the city has to offer. Changi Airport is incredibly efficient. You get off the plane quickly, the toilets are clean, and immigration is a breeze with everything automated. Your bags arrive fast, and grabbing a taxi is just as smooth. There’s no traffic, and the drive from the airport is lined with trees and flowers. It feels like you’ve arrived in a city that’s really well thought out.

The drive to downtown is almost surreal. The roads are clean, and there’s no traffic—a luxury even some of the world’s most developed cities can’t offer. The downtown area has beautiful hotels surrounded by greenery. It’s hard to think of many cities that compare to this, and it immediately sets Singapore apart as a place that’s not just efficient but also visually appealing.

# 2. Living in Singapore: Housing and Infrastructure

Living in Singapore, you mainly have two housing options as a foreigner on an employment pass: HDBs and condos. HDBs, where most Singaporeans live, are government-built and are no-frills, low-cost housing. They’re clean, functional, and safe. Many have been owned and renovated by families for generations, and the government encourages families to stay close, so it’s common to find grandparents living nearby. HDBs are also close to MRT stations, making them very convenient. I think HDBs are probably the most organized and well-run housing solution I’ve seen, offering a good option for people of all income levels.

On the other hand, condos, where we chose to live, offer more amenities and are where expats and wealthier Singaporeans tend to live. Condos in Singapore are similar to luxury units in big cities like Tokyo, Shanghai, or New York, with features like pools, lobbies, and other frills. But what really sets Singapore apart is the infrastructure. I can leave my condo and ride my bike on park connectors for kilometers without crossing a single road. The city’s small size means that most places are within a 15-30 minute commute, which is a big difference from the long commutes I experienced in places like London or New York. This proximity and connectivity have greatly improved our quality of life.

# 3. Raising a Family in Singapore

Raising a family in Singapore comes with both opportunities and challenges. As a foreigner on an employment pass, we had the option of sending our kids to international or local schools. International schools in Singapore are excellent but expensive—around SGD 35,000 to 40,000 per year per child, including transportation and other costs.

Local schools, on the other hand, are highly competitive and are seen as just as strong, if not stronger, than international schools. But getting into local schools as an employment pass holder requires passing a rigorous qualification process. My kids had to take the Cambridge English assessment, which we couldn’t do from the U.S., so we had to come to Singapore to take it, adding complexity to the process. After passing the English test, they had to take a standardized test in Singapore, which was better organized. The process could be improved by accepting more types of English tests to make it easier for expat families.

Despite these initial challenges, our experience with local schools has been very positive. The schools are highly competitive, with a strong focus on STEM and languages, especially English and Chinese. The students are disciplined and studious, creating a great learning environment. Compared to our experience in Florida, where students were less respectful of teachers, the discipline here is refreshing. My kids have thrived in this environment, excelling in science and math, though they do find Chinese challenging. While some say Singapore’s school system doesn’t leave much room for creativity, I believe government schools should focus on the basics. Creativity and entrepreneurship can be developed through extracurricular activities, which we’ve made sure our kids have access to.

# 4. Business Environment: Opportunities and Challenges

While Singapore is known for its pro-business policies and low taxes, I’ve found the business environment here less impressive compared to the U.S., especially Silicon Valley. Many of the smartest and hardest-working people in Singapore work for the government rather than in private enterprise. Local entrepreneurs often seem to have their hands held and lack the cutthroat mindset needed for real innovation. It feels like some are playing startup for their resumes rather than fully embracing the risks and challenges of entrepreneurship.

Many expats in Singapore work at APAC headquarters of global corporations, often seeing their time here as a career break rather than a place for significant advancement. Innovation in the region tends to be reactive, with a focus on safe careers rather than leading in their fields. I see more potential for business growth in countries like Japan, Korea, China, and Australia, rather than Southeast Asia. However, I’m still interested in working with those in Singapore who are willing to challenge the status quo.

# 5. Law, Order, and Public Safety

One of the most surprising aspects of living in Singapore is that, despite its strict laws, I feel a greater sense of freedom here than in many other places. The strong stance on law and order has created a very safe environment, especially for women and children. My kids can take public transport or bike around the city without fear, something that would be unthinkable in many other cities. The crime rate is low, and there’s a general sense of trust—people often leave their belongings unattended without fear of theft.

Singapore’s immigration policy is another aspect I admire. It’s pragmatic and proactive, almost like an HR department assembling an efficient society. The government is selective about who gets permanent residency, focusing on individuals in high-demand fields like technology and biotech. Lower-skilled workers can still get work passes, but there’s a clear difference in how different types of workers are treated. I think this approach is smart and necessary for maintaining the country’s high standards of living.

# 6. Exercise, Health, and Lifestyle

Fitness has always been a big part of my life, and moving to Singapore has allowed me to unlock even more potential. With less time spent in traffic and more time for exercise, I’m able to do three to four hours of physical activity every day, despite a recent knee injury. The city offers a wide range of options, from walking and yoga to cycling and more technical sports like mountain biking.

Walking around Singapore, it’s clear that people here are generally fit and health-conscious. The city has a high GDP per capita, so people can afford to prioritize their health, whether through regular exercise, proper nutrition, or mental health support. 

# 7. Social Life: Dining, Entertainment, and the Arts

Social life in Singapore is vibrant, with an abundance of great restaurants, bars, clubs, and cultural activities. The city offers everything from affordable meals at hawker centers to fine dining experiences that rival the best in the world. One of the advantages of living here is the availability of top-notch restaurants without the long waitlists common in cities like New York or London.

While Singapore excels in providing access to international art and cultural exhibits, the local art scene is somewhat less prominent. The focus tends to be on the great masters rather than fostering local creativity, which can give the cultural scene a somewhat synthetic feel. But given the city’s small size and concentration, this makes sense.

# 8. Bottom line

Overall, Singapore offers a remarkable quality of life, combining safety, efficiency, and a rich social scene. It’s a place where I’ve found more freedom than expected, and while there are areas for improvement, the trade-offs are minimal compared to the benefits. Whether it’s for business, raising a family, or simply enjoying life, Singapore has proven to be an excellent choice.
