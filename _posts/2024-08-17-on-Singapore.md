title: On Singapore
---

As someone with libertarian views (with progressive social leanings) who values minimal government intervention and personal freedom, moving to Singapore was an interesting choice. I’ve spent most of my life in the U.S. and Canada, but my kids have called cities across Latin America, Europe, Africa, Asia, and Oceania ‘home’. 

Singapore stood out to me for its unique mix of safety, efficiency, and quality of life. Despite its reputation for strict governance, I’ve found that living in Singapore has given me a sense of freedom I didn’t fully expect.

I’m sharing some anecdotal evidence below, your mileage may vary.

1. Arrival, Infrastructure, and Living Experience

Arriving in Singapore immediately showcases the city’s efficiency and thoughtful design. Changi Airport is a model of organization—from quick deboarding to clean facilities, smooth immigration, and fast baggage handling. The drive from the airport, lined with trees and flowers, gives a first impression of a meticulously planned city. 

Living options for foreigners mainly include HDBs and condos. HDBs, where most Singaporeans live, are clean, functional, and conveniently located near MRT stations, offering an organized and well-run housing solution. Condos, where we chose to live, provide more amenities, like swimming pools and tennis courts. 

The city’s compact size and excellent infrastructure mean most destinations are within a 15-minute commute, significantly improving our quality of life.

2. Raising a Family and Education

Raising a family in Singapore comes with opportunities and challenges, particularly in education. As a foreigner on an employment pass, we had the option of sending our kids to either international or local schools. International schools are excellent but expensive, while local schools are highly competitive and offer a strong focus on STEM and languages. However, getting into local schools requires passing qualification tests, adding complexity for expat families.

Despite these initial challenges, our experience with local schools has been very positive. The disciplined and studious nature of students here creates an excellent learning environment. While some argue that Singapore’s school system leaves little room for creativity, I believe that government schools should focus on the basics, with creativity and entrepreneurship developed through extracurricular activities.

3. Business Environment, Governance, and Immigration

Singapore is known for its pro-business policies and low taxes, yet the business environment can feel less dynamic compared to places like Silicon Valley or Texas. Many of the brightest locals work for the government rather than in private enterprise, and local entrepreneurs often lack the cutthroat mindset needed for breakthrough innovation. This stems from Singapore’s governance, which emphasizes stability and public safety, creating a business culture that prioritizes safe careers over risk-taking.

Singapore’s immigration policy mirrors this structured approach, operating almost like an HR department meticulously assembling an efficient society. The government is highly selective about granting permanent residency, focusing on individuals in high-demand fields like technology and biotech. Lower-skilled workers are given work passes, but there’s a clear hierarchy in how different types of workers are treated.

Given Singapore’s significant resources, such as those managed by GIS and Temasek, there is a tremendous opportunity to position the country as a global leader in innovation. By leveraging these assets, Singapore can build on its foundation of stability and efficiency to drive world-class innovation. A collaborative effort between government and the private sector could unlock new potential, ensuring that Singapore not only adapts to the future but actively shapes it.

4. Exercise, Health, and Lifestyle

Fitness has always been a significant part of my life, and Singapore’s infrastructure supports an active lifestyle. With less time spent in traffic, I’m able to engage in three to four hours of physical activity daily. 

The city’s high GDP per capita allows residents to prioritize health, with widespread access to fitness facilities, proper nutrition, and mental health support. Walking around Singapore, it’s evident that people here are generally fit and health-conscious, contributing to the overall high quality of life.

5. Social Life and Cultural Scene

Singapore offers a vibrant social scene, with an abundance of dining options and cultural activities. From affordable meals at hawker centers to fine dining experiences that rival the best in the world, the city caters to a wide range of tastes. Top-notch restaurants are readily available without the long waitlists common in cities like New York or London.

While Singapore excels in providing access to international art and cultural exhibits, the local art scene is less prominent, often focusing on the great masters rather than fostering local creativity. However, given the city’s small size and concentration, this approach is understandable.

6. Final Impressions and Advice

Singapore offers a high quality of life, characterized by safety, efficiency, and a vibrant social scene. It’s an attractive option for business, raising a family, or simply enjoying life.

My advice to Singapore would be to embrace more risk-taking. The education system and professional culture produce disciplined, obedient individuals. Singapore attracts people with impressive resumes and prestigious backgrounds, fostering a culture of following rather than leading. This creates an opportunity: in a society where few take risks, those who do could find the rewards far outweigh the risks.
