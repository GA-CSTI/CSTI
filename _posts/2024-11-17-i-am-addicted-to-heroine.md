Title: I Am Addicted to Heroin

Addiction is a difficult thing to admit. It’s isolating, consuming, and often starts innocently—just a spark of curiosity. Curiosity becomes pleasure, pleasure becomes habit, and before long, the habit takes control. The cost mounts, often outweighing the fleeting benefits, yet the cycle persists. Breaking free feels like hell on earth, leaving scars—emotional, physical, and social.

You might be here, reading this, because you’re curious about my story. Maybe the shocking title drew you in: Danny, addicted to heroin? But let’s stop here—I’m not. The headline was a hook, a dose of intrigue designed to trigger your curiosity, much like the very addictions we grapple with in today’s digital age.

The Modern Addiction: Curiosity Clickbait

Think about why you’re still reading. You didn’t come for a sober analysis of addiction. You came because the headline promised something sensational, something raw. That spark of curiosity? That’s what platforms like TikTok, YouTube, and X have weaponized. They’ve turned supercomputers into tools for hijacking your brain, creating digital addictions more potent than ever before.

Years ago, Tristan Harris warned about this before Congress. Back then, YouTube’s algorithms were already manipulating our attention. Fast forward to now, and we’ve seen an explosion of platforms perfecting the art of distraction. Even “boring” spaces like LinkedIn are following suit, prioritizing viral personal stories and engagement metrics over substance. Posts about conferences and personal journeys might feel wholesome, but their purpose isn’t connection—it’s to keep you scrolling.

Addiction Starts Young

This conditioning doesn’t just affect adults. It starts young, often in subtle ways. Watch any group of kids at a restaurant, noses glued to screens, scrolling through games like Roblox or endless videos. What starts as a way to keep them occupied quietly becomes an unshakable habit. Over time, these seemingly harmless distractions develop into dependencies that shape their attention spans, their emotions, and even their ability to cope with boredom.

It’s critical that we teach children—and ourselves—how to recognize addiction. Breaking an addiction isn’t easy. There’s always a phase of withdrawal, where you miss the thing dearly, feel the pain of its absence, and question whether it’s worth resisting. But those who push through come out stronger, with a sense of control that’s worth far more than the fleeting pleasure of indulgence.

The Scope of Addiction: A Global Perspective

Addiction isn’t limited to substances; behaviors like gambling have become significant concerns. Globally, an estimated 300 million people used illegal drugs in 2021, with around 40 million considered problem drug users. In the United States, approximately 2 million adults are estimated to have a gambling disorder. Online gambling, in particular, has surged, with participation growing from 15% of the adult population in 2018 to 25% in 2021.

Video games, too, have become a major source of behavioral addiction, especially among children. Games like Roblox, which seem harmless on the surface, are designed to keep players engaged for hours through micro-rewards and social connections. These activities require little effort but provide immense gratification, which makes them addictive.

Good vs. Bad Addictions

Not all addictions are inherently bad. The key is effort. The most dangerous addictions—like substances, gambling, or binge eating—offer easy rewards but lead to long-term harm. In contrast, good addictions require effort, provide sustainable benefits, and often contribute to personal growth.

Examples of Good Addictions

	1.	Sports: Physical activity is challenging but rewarding. Unlike food or alcohol, sports don’t provide instant gratification. Instead, the benefits—strength, flexibility, cardiovascular health—compound over time.
	2.	Learning: Becoming addicted to acquiring knowledge—whether through books, courses, or experiences—is another effortful yet enriching pursuit.
	3.	Work: When balanced with other priorities, work can be a fulfilling addiction. Beyond economic rewards, it provides purpose, structure, and the opportunity to positively impact others.
	4.	Parenting: Raising children is perhaps the most challenging addiction of all. It demands sleepless nights, emotional resilience, and endless patience, with delayed but deeply meaningful rewards.

Teaching Resilience

Addiction isn’t just about avoiding bad habits—it’s about building resilience and teaching ourselves and our children how to manage cravings. Kids need to understand that the withdrawal phase—the longing, the discomfort—is temporary and can be overcome. Learning to face this discomfort, whether it’s by putting down the game controller or closing a social media app, is a skill that builds strength and self-control.

This is why it’s important to teach children about moderation and self-awareness from a young age. Whether it’s limiting screen time, discussing the risks of gambling, or helping them find joy in effortful activities like sports or creative pursuits, these lessons will shape their ability to choose good addictions over bad ones.

Choosing the Right Addictions

The addictions we cultivate shape our lives. Dangerous addictions—those that offer immediate pleasure with little effort—diminish us over time. They dull our capacity to enjoy the simpler, more sustainable joys of life.

In contrast, good addictions like sports, learning, or meaningful work are challenging and effortful but deeply rewarding. They foster growth, resilience, and purpose. They may not provide immediate highs, but they enrich our lives in the long term.

Final Thought: The Bliss Trap

The allure of bad addictions lies in their intensity. I’ve read that heroin provides a feeling so blissful that it renders everything else dull in comparison. That’s why these addictions are so dangerous—they reset our baseline for pleasure and make the effortful joys of life seem insignificant.

Choosing good addictions is one of the most important decisions you can make. Seek out pursuits that require effort, build you up, and leave you better than you were yesterday. That’s the only way to ensure your habits shape a life worth living.
