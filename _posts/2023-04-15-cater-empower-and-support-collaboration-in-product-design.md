title: Cater, Empower, and Support Collaboration in Product Design

Design is not reserved for designers alone; it's a collaborative process that teams do together. Moreover, tasteful design isn't limited to your latest "unique" app in Figma that leverages OpenAI's GPT-4 (large language model). It manifests itself every day, such as crafting emails, facilitating meetings, and writing blog posts!

bld.ai teams have built hundreds of products and many of them contain real-time collaborative elements. Common mistakes made by our designers are to assume that users will be beginners forever and to define roles/permissions, which inadvertently constrain users.

To address this, let's explore three key principles:

# ðŸŽ® 1. Cater to beginners and advanced users

Design interfaces that accommodate users with different skill levels.
Place documentation near actions to enhance discoverability, and provide advanced users with shortcuts, batch edits, and composable operations.

For example, in Age of Empires IV, beginners can use the mouse to select units and issue commands with tooltips for descriptions and shortcuts, while advanced users can efficiently control entire armies with just a few keystrokes.

# ðŸš€ 2 Empower and trust users

Trust users by granting them the freedom to perform operations beyond their "role," even those perceived as incorrect or unlikely.

For instance, I allow calendar invite recipients to make modifications, saving everyone time. Has this power been abused? No. This convenience enables rescheduling without consulting me.

# ðŸ”§ 3. Support error prevention and recovery

Ensure users can effortlessly identify errors (e.g., send emails/SMS confirmations for significant operations), and maintain a log of all changes made in the system.
Inform users about who made each change and when.
Support error correction with "undo" and "revert" options.

For example, in product management software, I'd like to see ticket reassignments without receiving email notifications for each change.
However, when a team member is added or removed from a project, I prefer to be notified.

This approach fosters trust and accelerates team collaboration. Good luck, fellow designers!
