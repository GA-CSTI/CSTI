title: DRAFT How to Write a Product Proposal 
category: "Digital Transformation"
tag: ["Template", "Product", "Letter of Proposal"]
---

Whether you are a new product manager at a startup or a junior partner consultant seeking the business of a large enterprise executing a digital transformation, chances are that you are struggling with creating strong proposals.

I propose here a framework for how to organize this proposal, as well as a few sample paragraphs which I have used before.

# Framework

The framework is organized in order of priority for the reader, who presumably will have to convince others to deploy the capital to build this product. Here's how the overall structure is organized:

0. Introduction letter
1. Executive summary: use situation, complication, resolution to describe the product
2. High-level approach
3. Estimated costs
4. Product benefits: revenue increase, cost decrease, risk mitigation
5. Product design: UX 
6. Product implementation: data sources, architecture, tech stack
7. Processes and tools: quality assurance, testing, cyber security

# Sample content

And here's the sample content.

## 0. Personalized letter

`<Date>`

Dear `<Names>`,

Thank you for the invitation to discuss the `<product idea>` opportunity with you. I want to help you achieve `<business goal>` by targetting `<customer segment>` with a brand positioning inspired by `<sample product>`.

The `<product>` can be placed in `<channel>`, promoted to people with `<incentives>` to increase adoption, and priced according to `<pricing hypothesis>`.

I've been thinking a lot about `<end user/customer>`, and realized that the most critical `<pain points>` can be addressed by the following features `<list features>`. While there are some `<list tradeoffs>` to consider, image a futuere where `<product vision>`.

I'm excited to work with you on this because I firmly believe in its role to ensure that `<company purpose>`.

Looking forward to a kickoff on `<Date>`.

Thank you,

`<Your name and contact info>`


## 1. Executive summary: use situation, complication, resolution to describe the product

### 1.1 Situation

The `<industry>` currently is adopting `<industry trends>`. More and more pressure (or opportunities) is coming from `<substitute products>` and new `<competitors>`. Customers now expect `<sample feature>` and have more market power than before. 

### 1.2 Complication (problem statement)

Your organization is accountable for `<business model>` to its customers. You are now positioned to capture `<opportunity size>`.

`<list the questions or most important user journey stories>`

### 1.3 Resolution 

`<Expand on customer needs and product>`

## 2. High-level approach

Based on your feedback, we propose a proof of concept phase, followed by a three-phased approach to build the two tools, from conception to quantifiable impact. At the end of each of the four phases, a stage gate meeting will be held to review completion of the work and make a decision on the best next steps. All of this will be done in close collaboration with `<relevant teams>`.

1. *Proof of concept (POC)*
    1. Conduct Google Ventures Design Sprint.
    2. Evaluate current data sources and pipelines.
    3. Implement proof of concept solution based sample data.
2. *User experience (UX), data gathering, and baseline tool*
    1. Interview stakeholders to understand the desired end user experience.
    2. Gather, test and validate data (internal, external, and vendor).
    3. Build an basetool that provides private test users with something tangible and is useful.
    4. Validate that the basetool brings value to the end user.
3. *Feature expansion*
    1. Develop the API against which the tools will connect, and setup the base processes (continuous integration/delivery, cyber security, quality assurance and testing, etc.).
    2. Implement and test web tool that connects to data in real time.
    3. Release the tool for a small set of test users, expanding from the initial private users.
    4. Validate UX hypothesis formulated in Phase 1 and adjust as necessary.
    5. Put in place metric to start to quantitatively (and objectively) measure the operational impact.
4. *Productionalization*
    1. Decide on the most valuable set of features to include in V1.0 of the product
    2. Implement required processes (cyber security, compliant, documentation, quality assurance, testing, etc.)
    3. Implement, monitor, and stabilize the product.
    4. Prepare deployment, and provide real-time world class support to ensure smooth and sequenced roll out to organization.


## 3. Estimated costs

We propose three ways to estimate the costs. 

### Time and material estimate

First is the time and material estiamte. Expect that a product team will have between 1 to 10 people at any given that. Anything more than 10 is becoming at risk of too much communication overhead. It is probably wiser to reduce the team size and reduce the set of features. If that's no possible, then consider splitting the product into two products. 

Blended market hourly rates for outsourced people in India, Philippines, or Eastern Europe will range from $20 to $80. If the work is performed on site in US/Canada/Europe, expect to pay $60 to $250. Anything more than that you are most likely paying overhead costs to the staffing agency/consulting company. For instance, it is not unheard of to see hourly rates in the $1,000+ range for partners in prestigious consulting firms (similar to top law firms). 

### Fixed cost estimate

The main advantage of a fixed cost estimate (e.g., borken down by phase) is its simplicity. The main drawback is that building a product is akin to doing research - the outcomes are always uncertain. While the time and material estimate is biased in favor of the people doing the work (because they have no "deadline"), the fixed cost estiamte is biased in favor of the company purchasing the services. 

### Target and cap cost

The contract is based on two figures: the “target price” and the “cap”.  The cap is the maximum that `<company financing the work>` will pay. The target is lower than the cap and the contract gives both parties a financial incentive to meet the target. If we `<provider of work>` come in under the target, the savings are shared equally between both parties.  Likewise, if we come in over the target, the extra cost is shared evenly – but only up to the cap.  If we reach the cap, it acts like a fixed price. The costs listed are target costs. Assume 25% extra for the cap.
