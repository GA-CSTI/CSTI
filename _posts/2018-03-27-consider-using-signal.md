title: Consider Using Signal
---

The Signal Protocol (which was developed by the two creators of Open Whisper Systems, including Moxie Marlinspike - the ex-head of security at Twitter) is implemented in closed source applications like Facebook's Whatsapp, Messenger, Google Allo, etc. The difference is that the Signal app and server code is open source, so it's easier for everyone in the world to ensure that 1) there are no bugs, and 2) the code isn't used to eavesdrop on you. Signal Foundation is non-profit (received 50M in funding) and the team is tiny (but highly talented).

WhatsApp co-founder Brian Acton, who left Facebook last year, has personally donated $50 million to start the Signal Foundation.

I don't endorse it or anything like that (I still use Facebook messenger, because I care more about communicating with people than some illusion of privacy), but if you want to try out Signal, install it here: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.thoughtcrime.securesms&hl=en https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/signal-private-messenger/id874139669?mt=8
