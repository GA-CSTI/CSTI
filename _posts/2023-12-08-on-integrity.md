Disclaimer: this was not written by artificial intelligence (e.g., an LLM). I prefer to avoid it to stay more authentic and credible.

I am currently writing a recommendation for an applicant to the Stanford Graduate School of Business. I’ve filled a number of those over the years for several schools, including MIT, Wharton, Harvard, and others. The Stanford one stands out for the quality of the words it uses in its “Leadership Assessment” scoring grid.

# Trustworthiness / Integrity
It's so good that I'm tempted to steal the words for my own leadership assessments going forward. There is one dimension, however, where I feel that not many people would score above a 3 out of 5. This dimension is entitled “Trustworthiness/Integrity”. I list the options below:

1. Follows the crowd; takes path of least resistance; gives in under pressure
2. Acts consistently with stated intentions, values, or beliefs when it is easy to do so
3. Acts spontaneously and consistently with stated intentions, values, or beliefs despite opposition
4. Initiates actions based on values or beliefs even though the actions may come with reputational risk; demonstrates the values of the team or organization publicly
5. Demonstrates high personal integrity even at personal cost; holds people accountable to the team or organizational values

## 1. Follows the crowd; takes path of least resistance; gives in under pressure

For most of the dimensions in the Leadership Assessment, I feel like even without grade inflation, I would score a lot of people 3, 4, or 5. But when it comes to integrity, really, I think I would score most people 1. And if I score overall organizations like major global corporations, then it's hard for me to think of many corporations, who wouldn't be a 1.

Even the bravest CEOs have a legal team and a public relations team who are experts at seeing that the voice of reason is to follow the crowd, give under pressure, and take the path of least resistance. It seems like a great survival instinct.

## 2. Acts consistently with stated intentions, values, or beliefs when it is easy to do so

Achieving a 2 is not trivial. I myself certainly struggle to act consistently with my stated intentions, values, and beliefs. Sometimes it’s because I forget! But I try to live as authentically as possible.

## 3. Acts spontaneously and consistently with stated intentions, values, or beliefs despite opposition

When it comes to 3, I can easily think of people who would say and be convinced that they have a lot of integrity, but I am not so sure that they would act spontaneously. That's a High bar. I think a lot of people with integrity ultimately still go to their inner judge, and because they do have a certain amount of fear of the opposition and how it's gonna make them look, even if they know the right answer spontaneously. It's a survival trait. Perhaps only the top 5% of the people I know would score 3 and I think I know a lot of outstanding people..

## 4. Initiates actions based on values or beliefs even though the actions may come with reputational risk; demonstrates the values of the team or organization publicly

Now scoring a 4 is quite a feat. We're talking about reputational risk here! It seems that most people are risk averse and that's a good thing. Personally, I think that I would score a 4 but it’s foolish and I can only afford reputational risk because I'm playing this game of life on easy mode: I'm a white male with a degree from a top school, having worked at a big brand companies, and having received funding from top VC and incubators. I can take the risk because the system is rigged in my favor.

When I see negative reviews on glassdoor, or on Reddit or on a team barometer at a global consultant company, I don't let those affect me. I do pay attention to them, but I pay attention even more to (my illusion of) what the truth is. I certainly acknowledge that it could be wrong, but as the owner of a quasi, rational cognitive system, I have to do the best that I can with what I do know, and what I do believe to be true. I'm responsible and accountable to do the right things.

But for anyone who is less privileged (due to gender, race, ethnicity, religion, wealth, school reputation, sexual orientation, disabilities, looks, opportunities in life, and so much more), I feel like it's more risky to operate with a 4 or more on integrity.

## 5. Demonstrates high personal integrity even at personal cost; holds people accountable to the team or organizational values

When it comes to 5, It goes beyond reputation, but also to hold other people on the team in the organization to bear this cost. Now, I don't know that I have the courage to operate at a 5 consistently. Perhaps people like Elon Musk, and Paul Graham are a few that come to mind who would. But maybe that’s because they have so much going for them? (they are associated with brands such as Tesla, SpaceX, X, Y-Combinator, Stripe, AirBnb, etc.)

# Is the Stanford grid wrong or are we collectively wrong?

I've heard some very wise people tell me things in the past, like “only the hypochondriac survive”, or “don’t be out of coverage”, or “fight like a pack/pride of wolves/lion”.

There's clearly a lot of wisdom in being risk averse and aligning with people inside the inner circle. In many cases, integrity is not a well defined and constant measure. By taking the time to reflect with others, you may arrive at a different set of conclusions, especially in cases where the recorded spoken or written words have irreversible effects.

## A good risk reward ratio for the courageous few?

But the fact that it's always the right answer to operate on an integrity score of 123 and avoid the risk means that perhaps those who do take the risk will be in a position where the rewards are going to be that much greater because no one else is taking the risk?

As an innovator, and a challenger, who does have a lot of things going on for themselves whether it's fair or not, I would argue that the mistakes, the reputational damage, and the risk are worth pennies, and that the rewards are worth pounds. At the very least, if you had a lot of integrity, and were wrong, well, you can admit it, and now you have a story to tell which might be worth a penny as well.

On the other hand, you took a risk, and it came out of cost, but you were right then you have a story to tell, and that story I argue is worth more than a penny.

## Building confidence

Overtime as you accumulate this, and as you make integrity, part of who you are the biggest value you gain is confidence.This confidence allows you to be more consistent and authentic in everything that you do.You will be able to think on the spot from first principal and arrive at efficient decision making.I've made some really big decisions in my life like getting married in less than three months or leaving my job at a major consulting firm, having received distinctive ratings right before now these played in my favor and so don't trust me on that maybe I got lucky but it did not my point here is thatI was able to have the confidence to make those big moves quickly in part because I am a four and I aspire to become a five one day.

To all of you guys who are aspiring to become Founders an interpreters to get people to rally behind your cause I wish you good luck, but even more importantly, I wish you courage to have a deep sense of integrity that is as strong as how it is defined in the leadership assessment of Stanford school of businesses.
