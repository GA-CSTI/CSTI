For the past year, I've been doing roughly 80% of my work while walking or riding my bike (except when my ACL and MCL injuries prevented it). While this approach isn't feasible for everyone—think chefs, physiotherapists, or graphic artists—many of us, especially knowledge workers, can incorporate more movement into our workday, regardless of whether we’re working remotely or from an office.

## How I Make It Work

My work revolves around three core activities: consuming information, deep thinking, and communicating with people. Here’s how I manage all three while staying active:

---

### Information Consumption

Staying informed while staying active is manageable by converting written content into audio:

1. **Source Variety**: I follow many sources such as [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com), [WSJ](https://www.wsj.com), [The Economist](https://www.economist.com), [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/), [Al Jazeera](https://www.aljazeera.com), [Science](https://www.science.org), and [Krebs](https://krebsonsecurity.com).
2. **Audio Features**: I use apps with built-in audio options to have articles read aloud during walks or rides.
3. **AI Support**: For articles without audio, I load them into ChatGPT or other AI tools for text-to-speech conversion.
4. **Flexible Queueing**: I set up 15 minutes of content at a time, allowing easy switching when finished.
5. **Longer Reads**: This setup also works for audiobooks and other in-depth content, keeping me updated while moving.

### Deep Thinking and Content Creation

For tasks like writing blog posts, emails, or proposals, I've adapted my process to work on the move:

1. **Voice Notes**: I capture thoughts through voice notes, using apps like Apple’s native tool or AIKO (which uses OpenAI's [whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper)).
2. **Transcription**: The audio is converted to text and further refined through AI tools like [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com), [Claude](https://claude.ai), [Perplexity](https://www.perplexity.ai), and [Grok](https://x.ai).
3. **Collaboration**: Once drafted, I share content via WhatsApp for feedback, streamlining collaborative refinement.

### Communication

Verbal communication is straightforward—I handle calls easily while walking. Since I’m often on the receiving end of presentations, my focus is on listening, not screen-sharing or presenting.

## Intentional Work: Reducing Distraction by Staying Active

Working on the move doesn’t just boost physical health; it also helps eliminate distractions. Nir Eyal’s book, *Indistractable*, highlights how intentional action, or “traction,” counters the pull of distraction. Moving while working helps create that traction: there’s less temptation to shift focus because each task has been planned and aligned with the physical movement.

When I’m on a walk or bike ride, I’m not sitting at a desk where distractions are a click away. This naturally leads to a more productive, focused workflow. Planning work for a walk—choosing specific calls, articles, or notes—adds purpose and intentionality, making it easier to dive deep and avoid procrastination.

## A Challenge to Knowledge Workers

This approach isn’t limited to remote workers or executives. For professionals in traditional office settings—especially those in listed companies returning to the office—it’s equally viable. Imagine fitting movement into your day:

1. **Walking Meetings**: If you don’t need to sit in a conference room, suggest taking a walk. Lunchtime or afternoon check-ins can be ideal for this.
2. **Active Strategy Sessions**: Instead of gathering in coffee shops or break rooms, consider discussing ideas while walking around the block.
3. **Capturing Conversations**: Record notes or discussions with colleagues, then refine them with AI support afterward.

This mindset shift—toward an “active professional” approach—can yield measurable benefits, from improved health and mindset to more dynamic, engaging conversations.

## The Power of Walking Meetings

Some of the best minds in business—like Paul Graham and Steve Jobs—were known for walking meetings. This approach isn’t just trendy; it fosters deeper, more connected dialogue. Walking side-by-side enables discussions that are more fluid and dynamic than traditional sit-down meetings.

For professionals especially, movement drives stronger connections and market understanding. Prioritize:

1. Reaching people in their environment.
2. Fostering genuine conversations (many achievable while walking).
3. Building relationships through direct communication channels.
4. Understanding your audience through personal engagement.

## The Broader Benefits

This lifestyle comes with substantial benefits:

1. Enhanced calorie burn.
2. Improved sleep quality.
3. Physical activity without extra time costs.
4. Uninterrupted productivity while active.

Movement is more than an activity; it’s a method for achieving focus and intentionality. In *Indistractable*, Nir Eyal emphasizes that every action we take either pulls us toward our goals or away from them. Movement provides that traction—the physical momentum that translates into mental clarity.

So here’s the challenge: ask yourself, what percentage of your day could you spend in motion? Even starting with one or two intentional walking meetings or a half-hour lunch break walk each week could start to rewire your habits, replacing distraction with focus.

In the end, the choice is yours. Keep it static, or move forward.
