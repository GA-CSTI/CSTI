Title: On Having More Kids
---



Lately, I’ve been thinking a lot about transparency and bringing more of my personal life into the open. Not for the sake of oversharing, but because I believe deeply in being a consistent person across all domains of life. In Silicon Valley, we’ve seen a shift where many leaders are using X to share their raw, unfiltered thoughts. I’ve embraced that in my personal life, but less so in the digital world. This post is an attempt to change that.

This isn’t about washing my dirty laundry in public. It’s about taking a stance on something deeply personal yet universally relevant: having kids. In one sense, this has nothing to do with my business ventures. But in another, it has everything to do with every company I’ve ever built.

## Investing in the Future Starts With Investing in Youth

Elon Musk talks about making humanity a multi-planetary species. I admire that vision and support it. But an equally noble goal is making the world (or any world we inhabit) better by raising the best possible next generation. That means having kids in numbers and quality. It means educating them well, instilling strong values, and preparing them to build a better future.

This belief underpins my work in business, whether it’s education, transparency, or improving efficiency in professional services and startup ecosystems. At its core, my work has always been about empowering young people, new ideas, and the next generation of leaders.

On a personal level, I’ve always known I wanted to be a dad. I’ve always said I wanted five kids, but that’s just because saying 10, 20, or 100 would make me sound crazy. And maybe I am, in some way. But this isn’t about a Genghis Khan-style legacy where 25% of the world’s population carries my DNA. It’s about the number of people I can personally influence and set on a path to become the best citizens of tomorrow.

The shared DNA isn’t the essential part—it’s just an efficient mechanism for forming strong bonds. If we lived in an Inuit-style society where children were collectively raised by the whole community, I’d embrace that too. But given how society is structured today, biological children are the easiest way to scale that influence. That said, I’m not against adoption. I may go down that path one day, but my primary goal is to be deeply involved in raising as many well-equipped children as possible.

## The Midlife Crisis No One Talks About

Maybe this is my version of a midlife crisis. Women start thinking seriously about fertility in their 30s. For men, maybe it happens at 40. It’s not about declining fertility—it’s about realizing that if I have kids too late, I might not be able to play sports with them, to physically keep up with them in their prime.

Of course, I plan to be healthy into my 70s, 80s, and beyond. But there’s a difference between being active and being able to roll on the Jiu-Jitsu mats with your 15-year-old son. That realization is hitting me now. It’s not a desire for a Ferrari, a yacht, or a NetJets membership. It’s the realization that what I truly want is more kids.

And this isn’t some passing thought—it’s been with me for as long as I can remember. If you spend quality time with me in private, you already know this. It’s something I think about multiple times a day. It’s a recurring theme in my life.

I ride 10km every morning to drop my kids off at school, talking with them along the way. I pick them up in the afternoon. I train Jiu-Jitsu with them. I’ve homeschooled them while traveling the world. I’ve involved them in my businesses, teaching them about innovation and problem-solving. They are fully integrated into my life. And to me, the only logical extension of that is to have more of them.

## The Math of Legacy

Yes, overpopulation is a concern. The Earth can’t sustain 500 billion people. Maybe 10 billion is be optimal? I'm sure Bill Gates has something intelligent to say about that.

But the bigger problem, in my opinion, isn’t too many people: it’s that the most educated, successful, and resourceful people are the ones who stop having kids.

I’ve been mentored by incredible people. I’ve accumulated knowledge and skills that took others years and vast resources to pass down. If I don’t pass that forward, what was the point? If I have five kids, and they each have five kids, that’s 25 grandchildren. If they each have five, that’s 125 great-grandchildren. That’s an entire lineage influenced by the knowledge, values, and mindset I’ve built over my lifetime.

It’s not about numbers alone—it’s about quality. It’s about being present, spending time, and instilling values like creativity, mathematics, systems thinking, generosity, openness, and transparency.

## Encouraging Others to Take the Leap

So, yes, I want to encourage people to have kids. Not out of obligation, but because if you’re on the fence, it’s worth considering. Kids bring diversity—of thought, culture, and DNA. And if you can’t have kids naturally, adoption, fostering, or mentorship are all meaningful ways to create impact.

Raising kids is expensive—financially and in terms of time. But what else are you going to do with your life? Buy more toys? Accumulate wealth? We have the power to shape future generations in ways that no amount of money can.

Poor communities understand this instinctively. When everything is stacked against them, they still invest in children. Education, wealth, and career opportunities tend to reduce birth rates, which ensures fewer but better-supported children. That’s a good thing. I’m not advocating for blind reproduction. But for those with the means, education, and desire, I think having kids is one of the most meaningful things you can do.

This isn’t about pushing an agenda or shaming anyone. But if you’re hesitating, let me offer this perspective: having kids is a challenge, but it’s also the most rewarding addiction. It’s effortful, but it’s a service to the future.

So if you’re thinking about it—go for it. And enjoy the process.
