Title: Kids and Entrepreneurship
---

I have a deep interest in teaching entrepreneurship to kids. Not just because I have kids and [plan to have more](https://blog.dannycastonguay.com/on-having-more-kids/), but because I genuinely see investing in kids as the most meaningful thing we can do with our lifetime.

Kids influence future generations, and if we truly care about the future, we must start by nurturing young minds.

I've always considered myself a kid at heart—endlessly curious, playful, and exploratory. Unlike a laser, which focuses sharply on one narrow problem, I approach problem-solving like a lantern, illuminating and exploring the entire space to find solutions. I prefer people who think like this—creative, curious, and multidimensional. In contrast, I find people who obsess over money and retirement disappointingly shallow. They are no longer apex innovators, just comfortable repeaters.

The current educational system, with its heavy emphasis on obedience and standardized testing, is completely misaligned with this creative and exploratory mindset. Exams like Singapore’s PSLE, which essentially determine a child's future at age 12, measures in large part a child's obedience and ability to cram information. It's a traumatic and counterproductive ritual. My daughter, for instance, is incredibly creative and entrepreneurial. At just 11, she started a sticker business, selling beautifully designed digital stickers. She's already thinking beyond stickers, considering printing her art on clothing and using vending machines for distribution. Why should she waste her next two years preparing for a test when she could scale her business and learn far more higher order skills and creativity?

AI provides us with a way out of this educational paradigm. Rather than focusing on standardized tests, education should leverage personalized AI-driven assessments, continuously gauging understanding, curiosity, and creativity in real time. Every child should have a digital twin. In other words, a personalized AI agent constantly tracking their knowledge, identifying gaps, and suggesting new, engaging learning paths tailored to each child's unique interests and abilities. With such a system, tests become obsolete because the AI already knows precisely what the child understands and what they still need to explore.

In my company, bld.ai, we're applying similar principles to adults. Our AI agents guide professional service providers through their careers, suggesting relevant skills and helping them innovate continuously. Eventually, I'd love to extend this approach to children, providing them the tools and resources to start experimenting, building businesses, or conducting meaningful research from a young age.

Imagine a future where kids are free from anxiety-inducing exams, where their natural creativity and curiosity are encouraged instead of stifled. Imagine children growing into innovators, entrepreneurs, and critical thinkers from an early age. This isn’t a distant dream—it's within reach if we embrace AI's potential to transform education from rigid standardization into dynamic, personalized, lifelong learning.
