Title: TwinGPT: Building Large Foundational Models for Enterprises
---

#### TLDR
In my previous post, I outlined how enterprises can deploy a Digital Twin (DT) as a minimum viable product (MVP) in six months for $1M. While many organizations embraced this concept, most have not advanced beyond the MVP stage. Today, advancements in foundational models for sensor data and cost-efficient AI development demand a new level of commitment. By building large foundational models—integrating text and sensor data—enterprises can redefine their industries. This follow-on explains why it’s imperative to act now and how to do it.

#### Context and Reason for This Follow-On

A few years ago, I shared a blog post titled “Deploy a Digital Twin in 6 Months for $1M USD.” It outlined how enterprises could build a baseline digital twin (DT) as an MVP, focusing on data connectivity, an operational simulator, and some early-stage autonomous algorithms. The results so far show that while many organizations agree digital twins are essential, most still do not have a robust, mature version in place. In other words, that first blog post was only the beginning—an MVP that demonstrated feasibility.

Today, we see two important developments that underscore why enterprises must double down on their digital twin strategies:

1. **Large Sensor Model Progress**: There has been exciting work in building foundation models for sensor data—not just text but physiological or environmental sensor streams. For example, the paper *Scaling Wearable Foundation Models* shows how continuous, multimodal sensor data can be used to build massive “Large Sensor Models.” These models can go beyond words and incorporate signals like accelerometry, temperature, altimeter readings, and more—demonstrating that “tokens” can come from sources other than text. This approach translates nicely to industrial scenarios like logistics, mining, and manufacturing, enabling a “multi-layer” digital twin that captures sensor streams at scale.

2. **Foundational Model Methods Without Expensive RLHF**: A new paper by DeepSeek, *DeepSeek-R1: Incentivizing Reasoning Capability in LLMs via Reinforcement Learning,* illustrates that one can build highly capable large language models without extensive reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) or other overly costly steps. While RLHF can further refine a model, the DeepSeek experience suggests you can achieve powerful performance with carefully chosen data and reward signals alone—drastically reducing labor-intensive costs. This means you might stand up domain-specialized large models for operations, finance, or cybersecurity without the same multi-million-dollar human-labeling overhead as the earliest pioneer LLMs.

**Bottom line**: The first post showed that a $1M, six-month MVP is possible. But that was just a minimal viable product. If you are a serious corporation that wants to define and dominate your industry over the next decade—whether in healthcare, logistics, energy, or anything else—you should now move to building large foundational models for your most critical assets. You cannot outsource the intellectual property (IP) for these models; whoever owns the IP will command the sector. As before, not doing so borders on negligence: waiting to follow the crowd typically leads to missed opportunities.

#### Definition of a Digital Twin

A Digital Twin is a simulator—connected to real-time data feeds—that represents your key assets and is accessible to operations, planning, and risk teams via web/mobile interfaces. In my original post, I talked about how the Digital Twin has five main parts:

1. Interfaces: Human-centered front-end (web/mobile).
2. Data Feeds: Connections to real-time data, plus assumptions.
3. Simulator: Predicts future states given a current state.
4. Autonomous Algorithms: Tools for decision-making (optimization, ML, etc.).
5. Disruption Models: Stress tests the system with scenario data.

**Reiterating the MVP**

That structure was never meant to be the final stage. We have arrived at a point where you must add large-scale data ingestion from diverse sensor sources and incorporate next-generation modeling techniques (foundation models) if you want your DT to be truly future-proof.

#### Benefits to Operations, Planning, and Risk Teams

A well-implemented DT:

- **Enhances Operational Visibility**: See real-time status across your entire fleet, factory, or supply chain; identify issues before they escalate.
- **Improves Planning**: Accurately schedule acquisitions or decommissioning with daily (not annual) data. This becomes even more critical when your twin integrates sensor-level data (like the Large Sensor Model approach).
- **Strengthens Risk Management**: Run “what-if” scenarios, factoring in disruptions such as cyber threats, weather extremes, or supply chain breakdowns.

Large foundational models—both from text and from “sensor tokens”—can transform your DT into a robust platform for predictive insights and intelligent decision-making.

#### How to Build It

The broad approach remains similar to the one I laid out originally. However, new tools and techniques around large foundational models (including sensor data ingestion) will now substantially upgrade each phase.

**4.1 Build a Human-Centered Web and Mobile Interface**

User experience still sits at the front of a good product. Operations, planning, and risk teams need easily interpretable dashboards, maps, or advanced analytics. This is arguably more important as you incorporate more data sources (e.g., from sensors). In the *Scaling Wearable Foundation Models* paper, the data had up to 40 million hours of sensor streams for just that domain—health and fitness. So in an industrial context, your front-end should help users focus on the right signals and not get flooded by extraneous detail.

A well-designed interface can even show AI-driven insights—like “future chokepoints” or “emerging anomalies”—so that your team can intervene before problems occur.

**4.2 Feed Your Digital Twin with Good Data**

Feeding your DT with richer, fresher, and multi-layer data is now simpler thanks to two developments:

1. **Inexpensive Sensor Data**: Internet-of-Things (IoT) platforms, cloud data ingestion, and existing industrial SCADA/PLC systems give you a trove of sensor signals. As illustrated in the large-sensor-model paper, foundation models can treat these signals as tokens. The advantage: you can unify textual data (“maintenance logs,” “warranty claims,” etc.) with sensor data (altimeter readings, accelerometry, temperature, etc.).
2. **Reduced Human Labeling Costs**: Historically, one barrier to using advanced AI was the massive labeling overhead (especially for unstructured data). Recent methods—like the approach from DeepSeek—show how you can train large, domain-specific models more cheaply, using more automated or rule-based feedback.

**4.2.1 Start by Increasing Granularity and Freshness of Existing Data**

Focus on removing unnecessary aggregation so you can operate at the raw or near-raw sensor resolution, if feasible. The Large Sensor Model works best with data that has minimal “flattening.” Cloud services with auto-scaling help mitigate the overhead of storing large volumes of data.

**4.2.2 Augment Your Data, Both Internally and Externally**

Beyond just refining the data you have, add new data sources—both sensor-based and from external providers. If you’re not ready to manage massive raw sensor streams, you can still glean a lot from smaller intervals or aggregated but uncompressed data. Look into free or low-cost external feeds (e.g., weather, freight indexes) to complement your internal data.

**4.3 Build the Simulator to Represent the World**

The core is still a simulator that predicts how your system evolves over time. But now, you can:

- **Explore Large Sensor Foundation Models**: These can be used to predict future states not just in terms of demand or production, but also sensor-based phenomena (e.g., vibrations, temperatures, user behaviors).
- **Incorporate Multi-Modal Data**: As the *Scaling Wearable Foundation Models* paper implies, you might unify textual signals with sensor signals in a single model. Imagine bridging operational logs (text) with vibration or temperature patterns (sensor) in one large multi-layer foundation model.

**4.3.1 Consider What You Need to Build**

Foundational models are flexible but can be big. The DeepSeek paper suggests you could achieve “very powerful at a fraction of the cost” if you skip or minimize RLHF. So for your domain, decide how big your model should be (maybe 10–70B parameters, or more). Then weigh whether you need human feedback at scale or if you can rely on self-supervision or minimal rule-based feedback.

**4.3.2 Build a Baseline Model**

Keep that baseline (like a simulator or simpler ML approach) to compare new methods. This also helps with interpretability.

**4.3.3 Build a Data Science Model**

Try standard frameworks (scikit-learn, PyTorch, etc.), but keep an eye on how to incorporate the new multi-modal, large-sensor approach. For instance, start with a partial transformation of sensor data into tokens, plus a language-model style architecture.

**4.3.4 Evaluate Performance**

Stick to test sets or robust cross-validation. For sensor-based models, out-of-distribution performance is particularly important. The new foundation model methods suggest you can do “continuous learning” as more data arrives.

**4.4 Autonomous Algorithms**

Once you have a robust simulator and large-sensor foundation, you can apply prescription-based algorithms:

1. Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP)
2. Simulation Based Optimization (SBO)
3. (Deep) Reinforcement Learning (RL)

**4.5 Disruption Modeling**

Stress-testing your DT for edge cases is essential. If you’ve integrated diverse sensor data, you can capture nuances of operational anomalies. That includes internal disruptions (like equipment malfunctions) and external hazards (like storms or supply chain halts). Continue to rely on well-tested methods to build scenario sets. With a robust, multi-layer model, you can pick up subtle trends and see, for example, that a certain temperature signature in your sensors is an early indicator of meltdown in a pump.

#### Timeline, Additional Considerations, and Cost

**5.1 Broad Timeline**

Reiterating the MVP from my previous post, you can usually stand up a baseline in about 6 months. For the first few weeks, you’ll do scoping and build a simulator. By 3–4 months, you should have disruptions and partial data streams integrated. By 6 months, you’ve got a real-time feed.

But now, if you want large-sensor-laced foundation models, you can expect to go an order of magnitude further in cost and time:

- **Phase 1 (6 Months, $1M)**: MVP with baseline sensor integration, simple simulator, minimal or no advanced foundation model.
- **Phase 2 (Additional 6–12 Months, $10M+)**: Build or license a large foundational model covering text + sensor tokens. Tailor it to your domain with some or minimal RL, and deploy.

**5.2 Additional Considerations**

- **Intellectual Property**: If you outsource the work, that’s okay, but do not outsource ownership of the model IP—that’s your moat.
- **Data Security**: Additional sensor data can create more points of vulnerability. This is also a reason to keep the core knowledge in-house.
- **Model Maintenance**: Foundation models constantly improve, plus you may want incremental fine-tuning. Consider it a “product” that requires continuous updates.

**5.3 Cost**

The ballpark for a small, dedicated team to deliver the MVP (with some help from external contractors) remains $400K–$750K over 6 months. But as I say, that’s just an MVP. If you’re aiming to incorporate large-sensor style foundation models (like the ones described in *Scaling Wearable Foundation Models*), plus domain specialization (like DeepSeek showed is possible with minimal RLHF), budget closer to $10M for that second phase.

**Final Word**

As before, not building a robust digital twin with a large foundation model is quickly becoming negligence. The evidence is in: sensor models can produce the same outsized returns as language-based LLMs, but for real-world phenomena. Meanwhile, you do not need to break the bank with RLHF if you have strong domain data. The time is now. Make that MVP happen for $1M. Then scale up with an order-of-magnitude bigger investment—$10M—to harness the foundation model approach.

Own your IP. Set the industry example. Don’t wait.
