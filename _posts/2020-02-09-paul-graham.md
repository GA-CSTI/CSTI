I'm very much a beginner when it comes to reading texts out loud, but I find it useful because it makes me remember the texts that I read better. Below I have recorded myself reading an essay from [Paul Graham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Graham_(programmer)) entitled "The Hardest Lessons for Startups to Learn", which he published in April 2006.
