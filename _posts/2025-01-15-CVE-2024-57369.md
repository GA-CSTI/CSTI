Explanation of CVE-2024-57369
---
The typecho v1.2.1 is vulnerable to Clickjacking. Clickjacking, also known as a "UI redress attack", is when an attacker uses multiple transparent or opaque layers to
trick a user into clicking on a button or link on another page when they were intending to click on the top-level page. Thus, the attacker is "hijacking" clicks meant
for their page and routing them to another page, most likely owned by another application, domain, or both.
