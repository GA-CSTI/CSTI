## Abstract
The focus of this work is on developing a cognitive tool that predicts the most frequent HSE hazards with
the highest potential severity levels. The tool identifies these risks using a natural language processing
algorithm on HSE leading and lagging indicator reports submitted to an oilfield services companyâ€™s global
HSE reporting system. The purpose of the tool is to prioritize proactive actions and provide focus to raise
workforce awareness.
A natural language processing algorithm was developed to identify priority HSE risks based on
potential severity levels and frequency of occurrence. The algorithm uses vectorization, compression, and
clustering methods to categorize the risks by potential severity and frequency using a formulated risk index
methodology. In the pilot study, a user interface was developed to configure the frequency and the number
of the prioritized HSE risks that are to be communicated from the tool to those employees who opted to
receive the information in a given location.
