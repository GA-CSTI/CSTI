https://video-subtitle.tedcdn.com/talk/podcast/2017/None/LisaGenova_2017-480p-en.mp4 - TLDR; either you will have Alzheimer's or you will be taking care of someone who does. If you want to prevent the disease do two things: sleep more and learn new things (e.g., register and pass a course on functional programming, or buy yourself a Nintendo Switch and finish Zelda - both will challenge you in ways that will force your neuron network to increase through brain plasticity). In my case, I plan on sleeping more and learning new things by 1) breaking the McK mold I've grown into, 2) starting a new business focused on building, maintaining, and supporting digital and advanced analytics products, 3) resuming to teach topics I think relevant for this new business (e.g., Designing directly in code with ClojureScipt or ELM), 4) taking undergraduate foundational courses (math, physics, biology, education, etc.), and 5) starting a new business dedicated to helping teachers leverage AI to teach 0-10 year olds.


Caloric restriction also seems to slow down a whole group of diseases, including AZ: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/27240590/
