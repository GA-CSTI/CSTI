I went to elementary school in the late 80s/early 90s at Ecole Sacre-Coeur, in Bouchervile, Quebec. A secular, boys and girls public school filled with hundreds of middle class kids, mostly whites (french Canadians, catholics turned atheist in majority) with a handful of asians (from Hong Kong?), a few arabs (from Morocco and Lebanon), a couple blacks (from Haiti), and no hispanics, South Asians, or other races/nationalities as far as I recall. Racism, sexism, and other forms of discriminations were foreign to me. 

What was familiar was a belief that everyone has the same rights, and has the same potential for success - as long as we put our mind to it. Want to become Michael Jordan or Wayne Gretzky? Just practice shooting hoops or slapping some pucks every day and you will get there. And even if we all felt that physical attributes might not be totally fairly distributed, when it comes to intellect, then the belief in equality was more unequivocal. 

I remember the long days filled with demonstrations at the blackboard, and a generally slow, boring pace of learning. I wasn't challenged, and I doubt most other kids were either. I wasn't any significantly smarter or faster than anyone else (my average was definitely below straight A, especially in French).

If we were all equally "gifted" if we put our mind to it, then who were the slackers in the class room who didn't put in the work? Was there perhaps a different attribute, call it stamina or resilience, that differentiated us? 

As the years passed, my brother introduced me to The Bell Curve by Steven Pinker - a book that provided strong arguments in favor of nature (in the dilenma Nature Vs. Nurture). For a time, I believed that my genes made me a bit smarter and stronger than my peers, and it was up to "me" (or my "ego" as I later realized) to work hard to achieve high performance.

I've since turned the corner a fair bit on those beliefs (thanks to authors such as X, Y, and Z), and I'm back somewhat to the belief that when it comes to intellect, we *are* somewhat equal, and the differences, when applied in a team setting, can actually make us stronger. 

That being said, since I don't believe that any of us are very different in our abilities to learn new things for all practical purposes, then what do I value? I certainly believe that interviews are important, for instance, when assembling a team! 

I don't value intelligence or abilities much. You can code depth-first-search in Python in 10 minutes? Good for you! Rather, I value the process by which you are learning new things and challenging yourselves. I try to understand whether the software that runs in your head will be able to quickly get up to speed to solve the most important problems that face us. I try to gauge the extent. If you have 10 minutes and can concentrate on watching an animated video, I think it will be worth your time (it was valuable for me): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yl9TVbAal5s&feature=youtu.be

In a subsequent post, I explore a framework I'm proposing for evaluating the strength of a team member.
