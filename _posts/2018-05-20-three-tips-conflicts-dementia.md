title: Three tips to resolve conflicts with people affected with dementia
---

As our parents/grandparents age beautifully, many of them will be affected by dementia. My grandmother and grandaunt are both approaching 100 started losing memory. This video is practical for people with dementia, but really for kids and adults of all ages that are in the middle of an emotional reaction (including me sometimes!). Here are the tips that I think work for conflicts when the other person is unable to collaborate constructively (I paraphrased/improved):
1) start by acknowledging what they are saying - at the very least the emotion they are experiencing is true.
2) get them to acknowledge at least one important fact (and do not bother to correct every wrong detail, just focus on the important ones)
3) start to reason in their world without coming across as patronizing (you can't win if the other person can't reason through the argument - it's not about making sense in your world, it's about making sense in their world)
