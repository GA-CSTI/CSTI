Title: Joining Network School in March 2025
---

In March 2025, I’ll be joining Balaji’s [Network School](https://ns.com) in Forest City, Malaysia, next to Singapore. A few colleagues and partners from [bld.ai](https://www.bld.ai) will be joining as well.

I’m excited about this because while online networks have their benefits, the real value for me is having access to people in the same physical space—a co-working environment where meals, exercise, and sleep are handled. Talks and discussions will become the default form of entertainment.

🇸🇬 In Singapore, I already have a solid setup—daily exercise, meals handled, time with my kids. But at Network School, I’ll also have my colleagues around 24/7, which means we can move much faster on projects.

This is an experiment, and I hope more people join because I see this model continuing for a long time.

## What I’ll Be Working On

### 1. 📈 Scaling bld.ai’s Sales Without Me as the Bottleneck

My top priority is figuring out how to grow bld.ai’s sales without me driving everything.

We’ve built a strong track record with startups and enterprises, and the feedback on our work is excellent. But marketing, branding, and lead generation remain a difficult problem. We’ve tested multiple approaches, but we haven’t yet found a scalable, efficient way to communicate what we do.

What I do know is this: when someone requests a proposal, they’re consistently impressed. Our proposals are structured, clear, and actionable. So rather than trying to “sell” in the traditional sense, I want to make it easier for people to reach that stage—by improving automation around proposal generation and removing friction from the intake process.

The rest of our pipeline is solid:

1. Team assembly automation works well.
2. Workloads, invoicing, and collections are all streamlined.
3. Our partners, like Mahusai in the Philippines, deliver excellent work.

Beyond affordability and talent, our strength is in how we structure projects—breaking them into clear milestones while keeping execution flexible. This makes us competitive with internal teams, which often suffer from complacency.

The plan is to make it easier for companies to scope and initiate projects, with a more structured intake process.

### 2. 👩🎤 Building bld.ai Agents 👨🎤

At Network School, I’ll be focused on deploying bld.ai agents to streamline operations and reduce human bottlenecks.

#### A. Front-End: The Welcome Agent

The moment someone lands on bld.ai, they’ll be greeted by a Welcome Agent that determines what they need:

1. Clients → Sent to the Proposal Agent
2. Service Providers → Onboarded via the Service Agent
3. IP Vendors → Connected to the IP Onboarding Agent

These agents will be trained on our legal documents and workflows to speed up onboarding and reduce unnecessary back-and-forth.

#### B. Proposal Agent

This will help clients:

1. Scope out projects for innovation and knowledge work
2. Generate bld.ai-style proposals with the right structure
3. Connect with execution teams for validation and commitment

Clients can take these proposals and execute them with or without bld.ai. But in most cases, they’ll want our teams to review, validate, and execute.

#### C. Quality Assurance & Audit Agent

Once teams are formed, quality control becomes the next priority.

This agent will assess projects on:

1. Purpose alignment
2. Team agility and well-being
3. Coding standards & cybersecurity

Companies that aren’t hiring bld.ai teams will still be able to use this agent for internal project audits.

#### D. Operations & Finance Agents

These agents will handle:

1. Work logs, invoicing, collections
2. Purchase orders, payments
3. Risk profiling for financing

For example, service providers often wait 90 days for payment. Our Finance Agent will assess risk and determine if bld.ai should front the payment. Lower risk means lower margins for bld.ai, making it more efficient.

#### E. Learning & Entrepreneurship Agent

This agent will guide service providers in building their business within and beyond bld.ai. It will also offer structured learning on cybersecurity, DevOps, algorithms, and more—helping network participants improve their skills.

#### F. Investor & Transparency Agent

I want to make bld.ai’s financials transparent to shareholders and investors. This includes:

1. Revenue trends
2. Profit margins
3. Risk assessments

This ties into [FairStock.Trade](https://fairstock.trade), my second major focus.

### 3. 💱Relaunching FairStock Trade 

FairStock Trade is being relaunched as a cap table management and auction platform for startups.

1. Companies can sell shares from their treasury
2. Investors can bid in structured auctions
3. Shareholders can exit positions via secondary sales

Over time, FairStock Trade will evolve into a full broker-dealer or partner with one. But in the short term, it’s a tool for price discovery and structured liquidity.

Company boards will control which investors they accept, ensuring alignment with long-term goals.

#### 4. 👗 Launching Closet.gg (A New Fashion Venture)

The final project I’ll be working on is Closet.gg, a fashion startup with a different approach.

Instead of starting with retail, we begin inside people’s closets.

By creating digital twins of wardrobes, we gain deep insight into fashion preferences and trends. This opens up new ways to:

1. Curate outfits
2. Offer personalized fashion recommendations
3. Connect brands to customers based on real-world data

This is still early, but I believe the future of fashion starts with understanding what people already own.

## Final Thoughts

⭐ March 2025 will be a major milestone for bld.ai, FairStock Trade, and Closet.gg.

1. bld.ai → Automating sales, proposal generation, and quality assurance
2. FairStock Trade → Reshaping private market liquidity
3. Closet.gg → Reimagining fashion through wardrobe intelligence

The Network School setup will let me iterate quickly and build these projects efficiently.
