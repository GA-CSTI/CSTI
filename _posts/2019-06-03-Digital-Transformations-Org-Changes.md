Aside from the tech giants, established corporations have achieved success without ever learning to write good software fast and efficiently. And even seemingly very technologically competent organizations such as Sony, Blackberry, and Nokia have failed in good part due to poor delivery of digital tools. Delivering product they did, but not ones that met the user experience demanded by the market. 

Enters the [Digital Transformation (DX)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_transformation), which includes everything from "going paperless" to applying machine learning in real time to predict outcomes from semi-structured data.

I'm not going to rehash here the many [tips](https://www.cio.com/article/3211428/what-is-digital-transformation-a-necessary-disruption.html) and [roadmaps](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/financial-services/our-insights/a-roadmap-for-a-digital-transformation) created by the likes of CIO maganize and McKinsey&Company respectively. Rather, I'm going to be more prescriptive and propose one approach to begin an analytics journey, one that is infused from the start with the inevitability of having re-organizational changes down the road.

The main driver behind this approach is the realization that the analytics journey is filled with uncertainties, but also very rich in opportunities to capture savings, generate revenue, and be better corporate citizens for the environment. Here it is in five steps:

1. Setup the VC Model 
2. Identify problems worth solving
3. Host design sprints
4. Launch to production early
5. Kill the dogs, and accelerate the stars

# 1. Setup the VC Model

Create a new container organization setup like an internal Venture Capitalist. The Venture Capitalist model is very simple to understand, but sometimes not totally obvious to implement. The fundamental idea is to set aside funds to finance the operation of a series of small teams, and establish a cross-function board accountable for the deployment of the funds and stage gate reviews. It is important that the board be composed of senior leaders who represent the business, and who have a vested interest in seeing both the “funded ideas” and the affected businesses succeed.

## Maintain a fluid team structure

It may be tempting to create the ideal centralized or decentralized org chart from the start, but since you do not know ahead of time which ideas will succeed and by how much, it is better to delay this rigidity for as long as possible. In the same vein, it is important to be agile and capable of quickly scaling up and down teams. For this reason, a healthy mix of employees, contractors and consultants will be more efficient and adaptive in both the short and long run.

# 2. Identify problems worth solving

To mitigate the risks of failures, we recommend narrowing the scope of the teams at the on-set. This gives the team a clearer direction, and allows for a simpler set of metrics to evaluate the progress. For skunkworks type projects, we recommend strong guidelines limiting burn rate, and have clearly defined stage gates to avoid digging a bottomless pit.

Start picking a problem in the upper right corner of the feasibility vs. upside matrix. In other words, a highly feasible problem, with high potential upside. Make the scope as narrow as possible without sacrificing the need to have a positive ROI. Now pick a metric that will be easy to measure for the business so that the project’s success will not be debatable. 

# 3. Host design sprints

Paint a picture of what future success would look like. It’s easy to skip over this step, but it’s as important as the selection of the problem itself. By creating a clear, crisp picture (or even a video), it is easier to communicate to the affected organization and to the people joining the team what the future looks like. Make it real and involve stakeholders. Equipped with this picture, seek out a seasoned practitioner who will give you the right time of day and who will be overseeing the work. We highly recommend that you seek outside help and bring this person as a contractor. It will be significantly easier to get the very best talent to want to commit to working with you, and it will mitigate the downside risks for everyone.

## Google design sprint

I recommend that you head over to [Alex Jupiter's post](https://medium.theuxblog.com/a-product-design-toolkit-a-sprint-through-google-s-product-design-methodology-412b0743fadf), or watch the [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6A2WuEkZI&feature=youtu.be) and the [book](https://www.gv.com/sprint/) by Google Ventures.

# 4. Launch to production early

Your primary goal is to find so called "product market fit" (as originally defined, I believe, by [Marc Andreesen in 2007](https://web.stanford.edu/class/ee204/ProductMarketFit.html)), or in other words find the "stars" in the [growth share matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth%E2%80%93share_matrix) (also known as the BCG matrix). 

Engage the relevant stakeholder and do something quick and dirty at first. Pull a small data set and test. The key here is to focus on doing one thing that will move the metric as defined in Step 1. Review and improve on the User Experience and Communication developed in Step 2. Don't build a massive data pipeline unless you have a real end user of this Intelligence who would do something different with it. Sometimes just a great real-time visual might capture 80% of the value. 

# 5. Kill the dogs, and accelerate the stars

Anticipate that the bigger cost of this engine is the long term maintenance, so ensure that you will set aside budget going forward to maintain and continue to tune the engine. Do not build in a silo or build a shadow IT organization. Instead, leverage your existing IT as much as possible but do not expect that they have infinite resources to support you either. You may need to complement their team with temporary flex resources.
