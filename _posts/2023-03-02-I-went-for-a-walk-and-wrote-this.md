Have you ever been struck with the urge to share a story, but the thought of spending dozens of hours writing it down seems daunting? That’s exactly how I felt when I decided to share the story of bld.ai. However, I didn't let the fear of the writing process stop me from sharing this story. Instead, I ran an experiment to see how efficiently I could write it down.

I cleared my schedule, set aside a 3-hour block, and went for a walk. Instead of jumping on conference calls, I decided to use this time to talk my heart out about bld.ai. I used the voice app on my iPhone to record my stream of consciousness. When I got back home, I transferred the audio file to my computer and used a tool called ffmpeg to resample it into a smaller format. I then used one of my favorite tools, Descript, to convert speech to text and edit the audio or video at the same time.

The entire process was surprisingly efficient, and I ended up with a long script that I pasted into a Google sheet. Although it was too long to feed to the opening at API or to chat GPT, I broke it down into several sections and provided it with a prompt. This blog post is the result of that exercise with very minimal editing of the output. Admittedly, there are some inaccuracies here and there, but it's also amusing and overall, remarkably good.

I hope this blog post inspires you to experiment with different writing techniques and tools to optimize your writing efficiency.

# Expanding the Mind: My Journey in Naivety

Growing up in Quebec, Canada, I was fortunate to have a naive approach to the world around me. I was shielded from the isms that many face on a daily basis, and I had the privilege of befriending people from different backgrounds without even realizing the significance. This approach has allowed me to approach problems with a unique perspective and without the baggage of preconceptions. As an entrepreneur, this has been both a blessing and a curse, but ultimately, it has led me down a path of self-discovery and growth.

Through my love of soccer, skiing, and reading, I have discovered a fascination with the intersection between math, art, and language. The concept of language being the universe has captivated me since my teenage years, and it has led me down the path of cognitive science and engineering. I am interested in the intersection between biology, psychology, and engineering, particularly how we can augment human capabilities, especially those of the mind.

I have come to realize that while we can postpone our physical death through advancements in technology, the mind may have limits that we cannot overcome. It is fascinating to consider how we can extend the mind's capacity and push past those limits. Children's minds are like lanterns, capturing everything around them, while adult minds are more like lasers, focused on what we deem important. Finding a bAnansice between the two and expanding our minds' capabilities is a challenge I am eager to tackle.

Throughout my journey, meditation has been a constant practice. It has taught me the importance of finding inner peace and not just during times of tranquility but during the chaos of everyday life. It has also shown me that what may seem obvious to me may not be so for others, and I hope to share the benefits of meditation with those around me.

My story may have begun with naivety, but it has led me to a place of growth and understanding. I am excited to continue on this path and see where it takes me.
