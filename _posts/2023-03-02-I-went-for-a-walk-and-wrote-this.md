Have you ever been struck with the urge to share a story, but the thought of spending dozens of hours writing it down seems daunting? That’s exactly how I felt when I decided to share the story of [bld.ai](https://bld.ai). However, I didn't let the fear of the writing process stop me from sharing this story. Instead, I ran an experiment to see how efficiently I could write it down.

I cleared my schedule, set aside a 3-hour block, and went for a walk. Instead of jumping on conference calls, I decided to use this time to talk my heart out about bld.ai. I used the voice app on my iPhone to record my stream of consciousness. When I got back home, I transferred the audio file to my computer and used a tool called [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) to resample it into a smaller format. I then used one of my favorite tools, [Descript](https://www.descript.com/), to convert speech to text and edit the audio or video at the same time.

The entire process was surprisingly efficient, and I ended up with a long script that I pasted into a Google sheet. Although it was too long to feed to the opening at API or to chat GPT, I broke it down into several sections and provided it with a prompt. This blog post is the result of that exercise with very minimal editing of the output. Admittedly, there are some inaccuracies here and there, but it's also amusing and overall, remarkably good.

I hope this blog post inspires you to experiment with different writing techniques and tools to optimize your writing efficiency.

# 1. Expanding the Mind: My Journey in Naivety

Growing up in Quebec, Canada, I was fortunate to have a naive approach to the world around me. I was shielded from the isms that many face on a daily basis, and I had the privilege of befriending people from different backgrounds without even realizing the significance. This approach has allowed me to approach problems with a unique perspective and without the baggage of preconceptions. As an entrepreneur, this has been both a blessing and a curse, but ultimately, it has led me down a path of self-discovery and growth.

Through my love of soccer, skiing, and reading, I have discovered a fascination with the intersection between math, art, and language. The concept of the universe being made of language has captivated me since my teenage years ([are we living in a computer simulation?](https://academic.oup.com/pq/article-abstract/53/211/243/1610975)), and it has led me down the path of cognitive science and engineering. I am interested in the intersection between biology, psychology, and engineering, particularly how we can augment human capabilities, especially those of the mind.

I have come to realize that while we can postpone our physical death through advancements in technology, the mind may have limits that we cannot overcome. It is fascinating to consider how we can extend the mind's capacity and push past those limits. Children's minds are like lanterns, capturing everything around them, while adult minds are more like lasers, focused on what we deem important. Finding a balance between the two and expanding our minds' capabilities is a challenge I am eager to tackle.

My story may have begun with naivety, but it has led me to a place of growth and understanding. I am excited to continue on this path and see where it takes me.

# 2. Intersecting Artificial Intelligence and Engineering

As I reflect on my journey so far, I am optimistic about the possibilities at the intersection of artificial intelligence and engineering. Continuously improving our language and cognitive capabilities is critical for a lifelong journey of learning and problem-solving. Early childhood education is important, but I see a big opportunity to augment our cognitive abilities using advanced technologies.

My university education in computer engineering and machine learning fueled my interest in this field. I focused on hardware and quantum computers, exploring the [Shor's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shor%27s_algorithm) to decrypt modern cryptography. Later, I delved into AI and game theory, learning directly from top data scientists like [Shie Mannor](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=q1HlbIUAAAAJ), [Geoffrey Hinton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoffrey_Hinton), and [Rich Sutton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_S._Sutton). It was an exciting time to be in the field, but the path forward was not yet clear.

As I pursued my master's thesis, it felt like the most interesting problems were in finance, but they did not align with my long-term interests in augmenting human performance. While creating a better Go player was impressive, it paled in comparison to the complexity of understanding emotions and helping people cope with depression. It felt like solving these problems was orders of magnitude harder than anything we had tackled so far.

Despite the uncertainty of the field's direction, I left academia and joined McKinsey. Looking back, I am amazed by the progress we have made in the field since I left academia. OpenAI's release of ChatGPT in 2022 was a major milestone, and it is exciting to imagine what the future holds.

# 3. From Feeling Ill-Equipped to Founding a Startup

When I joined McKinsey, I thought I was ready for anything. However, I soon realized that I was ill-equipped for the job. I struggled with PowerPoint and lacked a strong presence in public speaking. But I didn't let that discourage me. Instead, I saw it as an opportunity to learn and grow. As I worked with different clients, I found that the solutions I had in mind were often too complex for their needs. I learned that simplicity is key, and that sometimes, the best solutions come from good old brain power.

Despite these challenges, I didn't give up. I knew that I wanted to apply my skills in machine learning to real-world problems. So, I decided to start my own company. My journey was not without its setbacks. I learned the hard way about the importance of legal contracts and personal guarantees. I also learned that not everyone is as honest and trustworthy as they seem.

But I didn't let those experiences deter me. I continued to pursue my dreams and eventually founded a startup that helps farmers in emerging markets move away from subsistence farming. Looking back on my journey, I realize that it was the challenges and setbacks that helped me grow and develop the skills I needed to succeed. I am grateful for those experiences and wouldn't be where I am today without them.

So, if you're facing challenges in your career or personal life, don't give up. Embrace those challenges as opportunities to learn and grow. And who knows, you might just end up surprising yourself with what you can accomplish."

# 4. Exploring Opportunities to Unlock Potential

As I reflect on my experiences, I am struck by the abundance of untapped potential among the top undergraduate students in public universities around the world. It is inspiring to see young, exceptional individuals who have both the cognitive abilities and personal qualities that make them truly exceptional. As an educator and innovator, it is my mission to not only identify these individuals but to help them and others unlock their potential.

I am optimistic about the possibilities for global innovation, which can be driven by a relatively small number of exceptional individuals within a large population. My goal is to reach a target market of about a hundred million people who are directly involved in innovation and who create new knowledge and intellectual property. This will require not only enhancing cognitive abilities but also supporting individuals in developing a range of skills, from software engineering to product management.

My own experiences as an adjunct professor and co-founder of a startup, Kalibrr, have convinced me that this is achievable. I was fortunate to work with exceptional individuals, including PhD students who were my co-faculty, who helped to develop the skills of hundreds of students. In particular, we were able to develop students' skills in Android development, software engineering, and product development. Some of the most exceptional students even joined our startup, which focused on building a digital twin for call center agents.

As I returned to McKinsey, I was able to use my experiences to become a thought leader in analytics and AI. I worked with clients in various industries, helping to lay the foundation for digital transformation. However, I also learned that there are many barriers to transformation and that it is not easy to change the world. Nonetheless, I remain committed to unlocking the potential of exceptional individuals and helping to drive innovation around the world.

# 5. Scaling Solutions for Knowledge Workers: A Call to Reimagine Consulting

As someone who has worked in the professional services (management consulting) industry, I understand the challenges of addressing complex problems and delivering value to clients. However, I believe that the current model for consulting falls short in several respects. While many firms claim to be experts in problem-solving, they often fail to prioritize execution and value creation.

My vision is to create a new type of consulting firm that addresses these shortcomings. This firm would provide a platform for top-tier knowledge workers to work on client projects at a fair and reasonable price. The focus would be on delivering value and impact rather than just charging exorbitant fees for work that could be done by more junior staff.

In my experience, many consulting firms suffer from a knowledge gap between the clients and the consulting team. The clients may not fully understand the problem they are facing, while the consultants may not fully understand the client's specific industry or culture. My new firm would prioritize building relationships with clients and truly understanding their needs.

# 6. Building a Sustainable Business

As a business leader, I believe that creating a sustainable business is more than just making profits. It's about being empathetic, approachable, and having an optimistic approach towards solving problems. It's also about being innovative and not being held back by greed, but instead focusing on scaling and solving problems that can make a difference in the world.

One of the core values of my company, bld.ai, is to create a culture where people are well-compensated and promoted based on their growth, not just a short-term bonus. We don't believe in outrageous salaries and instead focus on investing in people, so they can reach their full potential.

We also prioritize time and ensure that our people have a longer time horizon to plan and execute projects. This way, we can be agile, open to failure, and always learning. We believe that admitting failure is an essential part of innovation, and we encourage people to explore different ways of solving problems.

Furthermore, we are conscious of the resources we use and strive to use them more efficiently as a way to create a more sustainable future. We believe that having a modest lifestyle is healthier, and we encourage our people to be mindful of their consumption habits.

As we grow, we want to encourage more entrepreneurship, education, and investing in advanced academic research. We believe that our success should benefit not just us, but also the wider community. By building a sustainable business, we can create a positive impact that will last for years to come.

# 7. Creating Opportunities for Knowledge Workers

The world is full of problems that need solving, and I believe that we all have the potential to be a part of the solution. My experience has shown me that the key to success is having the right approach and mindset. As a product manager at at bld.ai, I am constantly seeking out new opportunities for our team to contribute to the betterment of society.

One of the ways we do this is by creating an infrastructure for knowledge workers to come together and work on solutions in an efficient and cost-effective manner. We believe that everyone deserves a chance to invest their time and expertise in solving problems, and that is what we offer. By providing a platform for individuals with subject matter expertise, engineers, and creatives to come together, we are creating a space for collaboration and innovation.

We understand that there is inherent risk involved in exploring new ideas and developing solutions, which is why we strive to strike a balance between investment and reward. We believe that it is important for everyone involved in the process to be transparent and clear about their expectations. That's why we have a clear contract with our clients that outlines the commission payable upon collection.

At bld.ai, we approach problem-solving with an agile mindset, combining a waterfall plan with a flexible team structure. This allows us to create a big picture plan that outlines deliverables, milestones, and success metrics, while also providing the flexibility to adjust the team structure as necessary.

Our team consists of individuals with a variety of skill sets and experiences, all working together towards a common goal. We believe that by investing in people and creating opportunities for collaboration, we can help drive real change and innovation.

# 8. Revolutionizing Professional Services with an Agile and Fair Marketplace

When I started bld.ai five years ago, I had a clear vision of a marketplace that would enable people to work collaboratively in an agile fashion, with competitive salaries and yet low prices for clients. Our objective was not just to provide talented individuals with job opportunities but to change the nature of how people work and create IP. And we knew it wasn't going to be easy. However, we started with a simple idea of a marketplace where clients could come, get assigned to a team, and that team would write a proposal for hourly work where they would pay for an hour and make a commission.

We began with an overhead of 10% and a 90% goal for people doing the work, but it didn't work out as we thought. Nevertheless, we persisted and learned from our naive start to develop the necessary financing, cash flows, and structure to create a more comprehensive system that catered to the needs of our clients and knowledge workers. We aimed to be more than just a talent marketplace like Upwork, Gigster, or Toptal. Our ultimate goal was to be more like Amazon, with more to offer than what's just available on the platform.

We believed in better utilization of resources and high-level timelines, clear potential deliverables, and transparent budgeting. With a focus on creating proposals, milestones, and executing in an agile fashion, we could adjust and have stage gates. Salaries were high, with a goal of 90%, which was a radical difference from the norm. We started with an MVP, onboarded vendors, and within a few months, we were ready to deploy 500 people on the platform.

But building a brand and demand for our marketplace proved to be difficult. However, we started serving Silicon Valley startups primarily and offered rock-bottom prices, growing with the startups. Although eventually, we couldn't scale as we wanted, it was a good starting point.

My genuine, naive nature may not be great for marketing or selling, but it's what makes me a captain obvious who states the obvious all day long. And this is what I believe will revolutionize professional services. With our agile approach, clear structure, and fair compensation, we aim to create a marketplace that caters to the needs of both clients and knowledge workers.


# 9. Building Our Future: A Journey from Startups to Large Enterprises

Our journey began with the creation of Ghost Town in year one, and in year two we focused on filling it with startups. Year three marked a significant breakthrough for us as we successfully served our first large tech company, leading to similar successes with other large enterprises. We soon realized the need to shift our focus from execution to sales, and by year four, we had grown to the point of outgrowing our processes and reaching our goal of going from one to 100 workers.

Year five brought some critical changes for us as we innovated on our margin to overcome cash flow issues and decided to shift towards a system-based approach rather than just growing through processes. We created a partner system or departments with P&L that allowed for decentralization and autonomy, enabling our partners to operate on a global scale without geographical limitations.

As we continue to grow, we remain optimistic, approachable, and empathetic, constantly pushing ourselves to achieve our goals with advanced and thoughtful decision-making. Our goal of doubling or tripling our revenue and increasing our workforce to 100 workers in four years has already been achieved in less than five years, and we continue to strive for even greater success. We believe in building a future that is not just profitable, but also equitable and sustainable, and we are proud of our journey so far.

# 10. Empowering Entrepreneurship

As the CEO of bld.ai, I am thrilled to see the amazing growth and development of our partners. The fact that our first partners are now operating in the Philippines, Colombia, Egypt, USA, Canada, Europe, and beyond is a testament to the power of our vision. At bld.ai, we believe in giving our partners the freedom to pursue their passions and choose their own path, whether it's data science, web three, front end, or videos. We offer complete flexibility, so partners can choose who they work with, what they work on, and how much they charge.

Our goal is to create an ecosystem of transparency, innovation, and digital twins for people and projects, where we can pay people as much as possible and foster as much innovation as possible. We want to give workers more creative freedom to spend their earnings, and that's why we introduced the innovative payment and budgeting systems. Partners can spend on each other without paying a margin, allowing them to take courses, build startups, or receive lectures.

We understand the importance of governance, and that's why we established an executive committee responsible for 10% overhead budget of bld.ai. We prioritize spending on building our own product and hiring teams to work on it. We also want to ensure the highest level of quality as we scale, which is why we implemented quality assurance and audits.

As we continue to push the envelope towards more innovation, we recognize that the one-size-fits-all formula may not be suitable for all partners. We offer flexibility, even allowing some partners to negotiate a higher commission with clients, while still working within our network. We believe that empowering entrepreneurship and offering complete flexibility is the key to building great businesses.

We aim to reach a million people on the bld.ai network by 2029, and we anticipate having a few large partners and a fat tail of smaller partners. We're excited about the possibilities, and we're looking forward to continuing to innovate and make a difference in the lives of our partners and their members.

# 11. Quality Assurance and Beyond: A Focus on Wellbeing

As a team, we have always believed in the power of third-party audits to ensure the quality of our work, and for this reason we ensure different partners act as third-party auditors.

To ensure that this process remained constructive, we established certain rules of engagement to prevent unhealthy competition between our partners. We created a system where partners could audit each other while maintaining a level of neutrality to give an honest and fair assessment of each other's work.

We soon discovered that quality assurance went beyond just compliance and regulations. It also included the well-being of our team members, making sure that they had fulfilling experiences and avoiding stress, mental, and physical health issues. We thus decided to make well-being a fundamental aspect of our auditing process, an essential part of ensuring quality work.

Our focus for the upcoming year will be to perfect our UX and push the envelope on quality assurance and audit. We believe in building a product that will last, and our focus remains on the team that creates it. We value our team's work and aim to keep them fulfilled, happy, and learning. We believe that by doing so, we enable them to create great products and achieve our objectives.

# 12. Becoming a Sophisticated Bank for Partners and Clients

We are determined to become a sophisticated bank for partners and clients. We believe that by doing this, we will be able to accelerate innovation in the world and enable ourselves to do a lot more. We understand that the one-size-fits-all approach doesn't work for everyone, and that's why we aim to become a bank that is approachable, empathetic, and optimistic.

Our goal is to incentivize the right behaviors in terms of risk-taking, days to pay collection, and quality assurance. We have developed a model that allows us to charge different margins for different partners and clients based on their unique situations. For instance, big partners might have a different situation than small partners, and partners in certain regions of the world might have a different situation than partners in other regions of the world.

We also understand that not all clients provide the same amount of risk, and that some clients might be happy to prepay, while some might want to pay in the future. Therefore, we have developed a formula that will safely incentivize the right behaviors in terms of risk-taking, days to pay collection, and quality assurance.

We are committed to improving our legal framework, contract management, and billing cycles to bill faster and collect faster. We want to position ourselves better for the future by experimenting with quality assurance until we're sure that it works.

We are confident that we will be able to sustain what we have and attract more entrepreneurs that want to grow. Our legal framework will enable us to onboard all large enterprises, and we will be well on our way to becoming one of the top banks in the world.

We are also working on [Fair Stock Trade](https://fairstock.trade/), a platform that will allow our employees to sell phantom shares and buy back our own shares. This platform will provide liquidity to people who have believed in us and will enable us to have a fair market value.

We are optimistic about our ability to build for the future and create a system that enables us to finance our growth and create liquidity. We are committed to being approachable, empathetic, and understanding of the needs of our clients, partners, and employees. We will continue to explore different financing options and work towards creating a system that benefits everyone involved."
