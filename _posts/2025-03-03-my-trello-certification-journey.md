I recently completed the Trello Essential Training course on LinkedIn Learning. Here's what I learned and how I'm applying these skills in my workflow.

## Why I Chose Trello

I've always been fascinated by visual project management tools, and Trello's card-based system seemed like the perfect fit for my brain's way of organizing information.

## The Learning Experience

The 2.5 hour course was well-structured and packed with practical information. I particularly enjoyed learning about:

* Setting up boards for different types of projects
* Using power-ups to extend functionality
* Automation tricks that save tons of time

## How I'm Using It Now

Now that I'm certified, I've implemented Trello for tracking my certification progress. Meta, right? Each certification I'm pursuing gets its own card, complete with checklists for study topics and due dates for exam scheduling.
