Title: On Judging People
---

When we say we don't judge, we usually mean we don't judge people based on the small stuff. It's impossible not to judge at all because having opinions is inherently human. Personally, I avoid judging people harshly for their mistakes or shortcomings because I strongly believe in second chances. Of course, even I have my limits, but generally, I'm known as someone who offers plenty of room for redemption.

Interestingly, I find a parallel to this perspective in the TV show "What We Do in the Shadows." The vampires in the show are often oblivious to contemporary social norms. They behave in ways they consider perfectly acceptable but appear absurd or inappropriate to the modern viewer. As someone who thinks differently, often contrarian and outside the accepted narratives, I can relate, not as a vampire obviously, but as someone whose values feel more timeless, less anchored to the shifting standards of the moment. People's opinions and norms have changed over history and will continue to evolve in the future.

Ultimately, my way of judging people aligns with my broader values. I care deeply about human health and potential, driven by visions of a future where humanity might build a Dyson sphere or climb the Kardashev scale. Everyone has immense potential, provided they nurture themselves. If people exercise daily, eat well, maintain mental health, and focus on constant learning, especially through math, they maximize their strength, both physically and mentally. Just as yoga stretches the body to maintain physical health, math challenges and strengthens the mind. It creates a stable framework of rationality that supports emotional resilience and growth. Yoga, in this sense, is math for the body, and math is yoga for the mind.

So yes, I guess I do judge people a little bit: on how much they take care of themselves. But don't worry, I'm here to help everyone do more yoga and math as we journey toward building that Dyson sphere. Because clearly, that's what humanity urgently needs.
