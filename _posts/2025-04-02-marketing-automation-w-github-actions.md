title: marketing automation with github actions
---

Yesterday, my intern went from minimal coding experience to deploying a powerful automation tool—all within a single afternoon. Using GitHub Actions and GPT-4, she built a workflow that summarizes and synthesizes my 20,000-token blog posts into customized messages for social media platforms, automatically posting via API.

Here's exactly how she did it:

First, early in the day, I added her as a contributor to my GitHub repository, which gave her immediate access to set things up independently. She began by strategizing her approach through a conversation with **ChatGPT**, clarifying the workflow she needed.

Next, she moved on to using **Cursor**, an intuitive IDE that generates code automatically based on simple explanations. Cursor helped her write both the Python scripts and GitHub Action YAML files seamlessly, committing changes directly to GitHub.

She then tested her GitHub Action, encountering some initial setbacks. For instance, the system used an outdated model version and displayed unclear error messages due to API key payment issues. However, she quickly identified and resolved these challenges by troubleshooting effectively.

The outcome? A robust automation system now generates tailored social media content effortlessly whenever I publish a new blog post. Although the process could fully automate content posting, we deliberately retained manual review because human insight remains valuable.

Looking ahead, there's potential to integrate visuals via **Sora** and voice narration through **Eleven Labs**, but these enhancements are for future iterations.

Most importantly, this exercise empowered her immensely. Mastering GitHub Actions and container deployment opens up endless possibilities—from advanced data science workflows to even more sophisticated automation.

In fact, everyone involved in running the overhead at bld.ai—from marketing to sales, proposal writing to procurement, invoicing to collection, and legal to investor relations—is actively working themselves out of their jobs through powerful automation and innovation.
