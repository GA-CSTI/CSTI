title: On Common Sense
---

Common sense is a tricky concept—often undervalued and misunderstood. People throw around the term like it means something is obvious or easy. But the truth is, what’s common sense to one person might not be to another. Our perspectives are shaped by different experiences, and what seems like common sense might actually be misleading or even wrong, depending on the situation.

Take the example of going outside without a hat when it’s cold. Many people might say it’s common sense that this will give you the flu. But that’s not entirely accurate. The flu is caused by a virus, not by cold weather alone. Sure, being cold might weaken your immune system, but you still need to be exposed to the flu virus to actually get sick. So, while it might be common belief, it’s not necessarily true.

What’s interesting about common sense is how it sometimes means forgetting everything you know and just doing the simplest thing that makes sense. It’s about using your whole head to come up with a solution—finding the most straightforward approach without getting bogged down in complexity. This is similar to Occam’s razor, where the simplest explanation is often the right one. But here’s the catch: simple doesn’t always mean correct, and it certainly doesn’t mean you should ignore expert advice. Instead, it’s about balancing practical judgment with informed decisions.

Too often, people rely on expertise or groupthink, rather than trusting their own practical judgment. Experts, with all their knowledge, can sometimes get caught up in complexity and lose sight of simple, effective solutions. Sometimes, stepping back and applying common sense—stripped of preconceived notions—can lead to better outcomes.

Let’s look at startups, for example. Many CEOs are advised to raise capital and build a product that meets a broad market need. The common advice is to identify a minimum set of features that will appeal to many customers, build a solid product around that, and scale. This advice gets repeated so often that it becomes a kind of groupthink.

But imagine asking someone with a different perspective—like a Chinese immigrant running a convenience store in San Diego—what to do. They might say, “Why not just give the customer what they want, even if it means doing something different than planned?” To them, common sense might mean taking the opportunity right in front of you, instead of sticking rigidly to a business model or trying to impress investors.

The key point here is that common sense varies depending on who you ask. To truly tap into it, you need to expand your data points—talk to people from all walks of life, from the homeless to the grandpa on the street corner, from kids to institutional investors. By applying a mosaic of perspectives, you can create a more practical, well-rounded approach to solving problems.

In the end, common sense is about staying grounded, keeping things simple, and being open to different viewpoints. It’s not about rejecting expertise but about balancing it with the everyday wisdom that comes from diverse experiences. By questioning what we consider common sense and seeking out varied perspectives, we can find solutions that are both practical and effective.
