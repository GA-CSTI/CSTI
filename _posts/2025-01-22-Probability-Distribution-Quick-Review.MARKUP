  In this post, Iâ€™ll cover the fundamental concepts that form the foundation for understanding 
  many topics in other posts on this blog.
</p>

<h2>Probability and Random Variables</h2> 
<p> A random variable \( X \) is a variable 
that can assume a set of possible states or outcomes. 
Each of these states has an associated probability, 
which quantifies the likelihood of the random variable taking on that state. 
</p> 

<p> 
For example, consider a random variable \( X \) 
that represents the result of flipping a <span style="color: red;">biased</span>
 coin, which can take two states: 
<ul style="font-size: 18px">
  <li>HEADS</li>
  <li>TAILS</li>
</ul>
</p>
If the probability of observing the outcome HEADS is 70%
<span style="font-size: 18px">$$ P(X = \text{HEADS}) = 0.7, $$</span>
then the probability of observing the outcome TAILS is 30%.<br>
</p>
<span style="font-size: 18px">\[ P(X = \text{TAILS}) = 1 - 0.7 = 0.3 \]</span>
<p>
Which is the rule that all probabilities must sum to 1 (100%). 
In other words, the probabilities of all possible states must satisfy the following condition: 
</p> 

$$ 
\sum_{i} P(X = x_i) = 1
$$

<p> This brings us to the concept of a <strong>probability distribution</strong>, 
which describes how the total probability of 1 is distributed among the possible 
states of a random variable. </p>

<h2>Probability Distribution</h2>
<p>
    A <strong>probability distribution</strong> is a function that maps outcomes to their corresponding probabilities.
    It describes how uncertainty is distributed among individual states in a system and characterizes the system as a whole.
</p>
<h3>Key Points:</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Total Probability:</strong> The total probability of all outcomes must equal 1. Therefore, the probability of one state cannot be changed independently of the others.</li>
    <li><strong>System Characterization:</strong> The probability distribution provides a complete description of the system, defining the uncertainty and likelihood of different states.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Examples of Probability Distributions:</h3>
<ol>
    <li>
        <strong>Fair Dice (Discrete Random Variable):</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>A discrete random variable consists of distinct states, such as the outcomes of rolling a fair die: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.</li>
            <li>The probabilities of all states must sum to 1:
                <br>
                <span style="font-size: 16px">\( P(1) + P(2) + P(3) + P(4) + P(5) + P(6) = 1 \)</span>
            </li>

        </ul>
    </li>

        <strong>Height of Adults (Continuous Random Variable):</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>A continuous random variable represents measurements that can take on any value within a range, such as the height of adults.</li>
            <li>The total probability is represented by the area under the curve of the probability density function (PDF), which must equal 1:
                $$
                 \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x) \, dx = 1
                 $$
            </li>
            <li>Below is a graph representation of the continuous probability distribution (normal distribution):</li>
