DRAFT

In my previous post [Building bespoke AI products to win in the age of software](https://blog.dannycastonguay.com/), I discussed how innovative organizations invest significantly in building their own proprietary AI products, and I gave advice on how leaders of major organizations can learn from startups (e.g., read Paul Graham’s essay on [the hardest lessons for startups to learn](http://paulgraham.com/startuplessons.html)).

(If you are looking for inspiration on what kinds of AI products you could build for your organization, you may enjoy reading a post I wrote on [how to build a digital twin in 6 months for 1M USD](https://blog.dannycastonguay.com/digital%20twin/deploy-a-digital-twin-in-6months-for-1MUSD/)).

If building AI products is a critical competitive advantage in the age of software, then a focus on the people building them should be a top priority. Consequently, a talent strategy centered on innovation needs to focus on attracting, training and retaining the very best Product Managers, User Experience Designers, Data Scientists, DevOps and Cybersecurity engineers. 

To measure the success of and give direction to your talent strategy, I propose a framework, which I named ASANA. The word [“asana”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asana) originally comes from the practice of yoga and refers to a body position that is steady and comfortable. In the practice of yoga, students often choose to challenge themselves in uncomfortable positions (e.g., [Eka Pada Rajakapotasana](https://www.gaia.com/article/pigeon-pose-eka-pada-rajakapotasana), also known as “pigeon pose”). Reaching an asana signifies finding calm and comfort despite the challenge so much so that one could find peace and mediate in that position for a few moments. I believe becoming an effective leader is an exercise in finding that comfort zone  in the face of frequent challenging situations.

You have reached ASANA when you have found the following strengths:

+ **A**vailability: you have people with the relevant skills and training ready to go.
+ **S**peed: your product builders can focus on crafting AI products with great user experience.
+ **A**gility: you can ramp up, ramp down, and adjust your small product teams and the org around it as needed.
+ **N**ecessity: the case for change is made, and your leadership recognizes its necessity.
+ **A**ffordability: the full lifecycle is costed out, including the future costs for maintenance, licensing and support.

# Availability

It’s a simple truth that no matter how talented the people in your organization are, there will always be more extremely qualified and ambitious people outside your team. This is true even if you are Google, Amazon, or Netflix. To reach out to them, go to your absolute best engineer or designer and ask them who the best person they know within their skillset is in the world, and in their network. Have them make introductions to you. At all times, you need to have at your fingertip a short list of people you can bring onboard quickly. If you are having trouble attracting or retaining those people, ask them why and fix it. 
 
# Speed

Assuming you have solved your availability problem and have the right people with the right skills either inside your organization or at hands reach, the next biggest impediment to going fast will be your team size: the bigger the team, the more overhead is required. Let me demonstrate.

Assuming that each team member needs to align once a week with every other team member a minimum of 1 hour, then we have the following:

1. Team of ONE has 0 minutes of alignment meetings, but has limited bandwidth
2. Team of TWO has 2 hours (twice 1 hour)
3. Team of THREE has 6 hours of alignment meetings
4. Team of FOUR has 12 hours of alignment meetings.5. Team of FIVE has 20 hours of alignment meetings
6. Team of SIX has 30 hours of alignment meetings
How about a team of 15? A whooping 210 hours wasted every week! The result is that people on larger teams don’t communicate enough and become uncoordinated. Sounds familiar? If your product team is going slow, sometimes less is more.

Another sure way to go slow is to try to please too many stakeholders/end users at the same time. A product team is better off making one user extremely happy than ten moderately happy. Stay focused.

# Agility

You are not going to get it right the first time. In fact, you are never going to get it perfect -ever. But, iteratively, you are going to question your assumptions every week and fix a small fraction of those until it’s good enough. If you gain new insights, you need to be ready to adjust quickly. Unfortunately, that may mean killing off a product if you identify you are not solving the right problem. Other times, it will be splitting up a team into two assigning different sets of features to each. 
A good way to ensure you can scale down teams quickly is to incorporate in your talent strategy 20%-40% as flex, that is a percentage of your talent is in the form of  independent contractors and outsourced product-building companies. 

# Necessity

Building a product worth the investment isn’t going to work out more than 10% of the time. In fact, if your batting average is higher than 10%, you are probably not going at bat often enough and are leaving a lot of opportunities unaddressed. You have to have confidence that the 10% that does succeed will be worth 100X it’s investment. If you don’t think that way, you are taking a huge risk to let your competitors out-innovate you. 

Consider the case of [Y-Combinator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y_Combinator), which has funded over 2,000 companies since 2005. As of 2014, they had invested over [$12M in those companies](https://techcrunch.com/2014/07/16/y-combinator-1-billion/), and today that number might be north of $20M, but not much more. As of today, the top 5% (102 companies) have a [cumulative valuation of $155B](https://www.ycombinator.com/topcompanies), including companies such as Stripe, Airbnb, Cruise, DoorDash, Instacart, Dropbox, gusto, Reddit, Docker, Twitch, GitLab, and Flexport. 

There is always room for innovation. 

If your leadership sees the necessity, they will make room at the top, they will promote people with the proper skills, and they will create career paths where people can continue to be hands-on. 

# Affordability

Because you are going to try a lot and are ready to fail, you will learn to run cheap experiments. If you keep your team small, you should be able to build a proof of concept in less than two months while maintaining a burn rate under 100K USD per month. If your proof of concept is successful, you should launch within six months, and achieve a cost of less than half a million. If you have been successful with one product and are now at the stage of fragmenting the team into 2-3 semi-independent product feature teams, then you should scale accordingly but continue to always have a long term view.

If you are consideringebuilding on a platform that requires you to pay licenses, you should go read my blog post on [Building Bespoke AI Products to Win in the Age of Software](https://blog.dannycastonguay.com/digital%20transformation/building-bespoke-ai-products-to-win-in-the-age-of-software/). 

That doesn’t mean that you should build everything from scratch using free and open-source software. Good candidates forr partners are companies that offer a consumption-base API as a service. A few good examples of that would include [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) for payment processing, [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/) for SMS, and [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation) for maps. Favorable reasons to buy these services instead of building them include:

1. They are highly reliable and available
2. They are priced competitively
3. They have very good publicly accessible documentation, which will save your engineer’s time
