In my previous post [Building bespoke AI products to win in the age of software](https://blog.dannycastonguay.com/digital%20transformation/building-bespoke-ai-products-to-win-in-the-age-of-software/), I discussed how innovative organizations invest significantly in building their own proprietary AI products.

If you are looking for inspiration on what kinds of AI products you could build for your organization, you may enjoy reading a post I wrote on [how to build a digital twin in 6 months for 1M USD](https://blog.dannycastonguay.com/digital%20twin/deploy-a-digital-twin-in-6months-for-1MUSD/).

# 1. Effective leaders in the age of software find calm and comfort despite chaos of innovation

To measure the success of and give direction to your AI product strategy, I propose a framework, which I named ASANA. The word [“asana”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asana) originally comes from the practice of yoga and refers to a body position that is steady and comfortable. In the practice of yoga, students often choose to challenge themselves in uncomfortable positions (e.g., [Eka Pada Rajakapotasana](https://www.gaia.com/article/pigeon-pose-eka-pada-rajakapotasana), also known as “pigeon pose”). Reaching an asana signifies finding calm and comfort despite the challenge so much so that one could find peace and meditate in that position for a few moments. I believe becoming an effective leader in the age of software is an exercise in finding that comfort zone in the face of frequent challenging situations.

# 2. Reaching your ASANA to overcome challenges associated with building AI products

You have reached ASANA when you and your organization have found the following strengths:

+ **A**vailability: you have access to highly trained people with world class skills ready to deliver, regardless of whether they are employees, contractors, or external talent providers.
+ **S**peed: your product builders can focus on crafting AI products with great user experience rather than fix or establish foundational elements.
+ **A**gility: you can ramp up, ramp down, and adjust your small product teams and the org around it as needed.
+ **N**ecessity: the case for change is made, and your leadership recognizes its necessity.
+ **A**ffordability: the full lifecycle is costed out, including the future costs for maintenance, licensing and support and you understand the cost of your delivery in near real time. 

I now take you through each dimension of the framework in more details.

## 2.1 Availability

No matter how talented the people in your organization are, there will always be more qualified and ambitious people outside your team. This is true even if you are Google, Amazon, or Netflix. 

In addition to your regular human resources hiring process and headhunters, you need to be ready to go the non-traditional route to avail talent. In fact, the best developers may not have a LinkedIn profile, and may not pass through your screening interviews. 

Here’s my not so secret sauce to find great product builders: go to your absolute best engineer or designer and ask them who the best person they know within their skillset is in the world, and in their network. Have them make introductions to you. 

At all times, you need to have at your fingertip a short list of people you can bring onboard quickly and the mechanism to utilize them even if they don’t want a permanent home in your organization. Central to availability is the dynamic process required outside of standard HR to flow talent in and out of the organization at a moments notice. 

Can you stand up a team in a day? Can you engage a niche vendor in under a week? If you are having trouble attracting or retaining those people, ask them why and fix it. 
 
## 2.2 Speed

Assuming you have solved your availability problem and have the right people with the right skills either inside your organization or at hands reach, the next biggest impediment to going fast will be your team size: the bigger the team, the more overhead is required. Let me demonstrate.

Assuming that each team member needs to align once a week with every other team member a minimum of 1 hour, then we have the following:

1. Team of ONE has 0 minutes of alignment meetings, but has limited bandwidth.
2. Team of TWO has 2 hours (twice 1 hour).
3. Team of THREE has 6 hours of alignment meetings.
4. Team of FOUR has 12 hours of alignment meetings.
5. Team of FIVE has 20 hours of alignment meetings.
6. Team of SIX has 30 hours of alignment meetings.

How about a team of 15? A whooping 210 hours wasted every week! The result is that people on larger teams don’t communicate enough and become uncoordinated. Sounds familiar? If your product team is going slow, remove people.

Another sure way to go slow is to try to please too many stakeholders/end users at the same time. A product team is better off making one user extremely happy than ten moderately happy. Stay focused. Also have to create the platform for speed. 

Can you afford to give your team's time every week to address technical debt? Remove everything from your people’s agenda that doesn’t push the product forward. 

## 2.3 Agility

You are not going to get it right the first time. In fact, you are never going to get it perfect - ever. But, iteratively, you are going to question your assumptions every week and fix a small fraction of those until it’s good enough. If you gain new insights, you need to be ready to adjust quickly. 

Unfortunately, that may mean killing off a product if you identify you are not solving the right problem. Other times, it will be splitting up a team into two assigning different sets of features to each. 

A good way to ensure you can scale down teams quickly is to incorporate in your talent strategy 20%-40% as flex, that is a percentage of your talent is in the form of independent contractors and outsourced product-building companies. 

Do your teams have short, clean, and prioritized backlogs? Your end users need to feel that they are being listened to, and your product builders need to know that the features they are releasing are having a positive impact.

## 2.4 Necessity

Necessity is something we can well define in evolutionary space. Necessity is a trait that satisfies the minimum requirement for survival under parameters that are selective. Sometimes, specimens can survive without meeting the minimum requirement because their general state is overall favorable. But, over time, selective pressure will tend to hone in and follow that necessity. 

While each case has its own peculiar signature, this is how innovation propagates. We live in the age of software, but transformation and adoption is progressive. There are different kinds of checks that keep change from happening too fast. Visionary entrepreneurs have the ability to identify necessity and find ways to accelerate that change. 

If you have availability, speed, and agility, then your case for pursuing your necessity is growing. Necessity is the easiest to achieve in a startup but the hardest in a publicly traded company. 

But identifying properly which product will turn out to be “necessary” in real time isn’t going to work out more than 10% of the time. In fact, if your batting average is higher than 10%, you are probably not going at bat often enough and are leaving a lot of opportunities unaddressed. You have to have confidence that the 10% that does succeed will be worth 100X it’s investment. If you don’t think that way, you are taking a huge risk to let your competitors out-innovate you. 

Consider the case of [Y-Combinator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y_Combinator), which has funded over 2,000 companies since 2005. As of 2014, they had invested over [$12M in those companies](https://techcrunch.com/2014/07/16/y-combinator-1-billion/), and today that number might be north of $20M, but not much more. As of today, the top 5% (102 companies) have a [cumulative valuation of $155B](https://www.ycombinator.com/topcompanies), including companies such as Stripe, Airbnb, Cruise, DoorDash, Instacart, Dropbox, gusto, Reddit, Docker, Twitch, GitLab, and Flexport. 

There is always room for innovation. 

Are your leaders so engaged with building your products that they too get involved in quality assurance? If your leadership sees the necessity, they will make room at the top, they will promote people with the proper skills, and they will create career paths where people can continue to be hands-on. 

# 2.5 Affordability

Every AI product that you build will continue to require maintenance over the evolution and lifetime of your organization. Having a sustainable strategy over the long run is essential. 

Because you are going to try a lot and are ready to fail, you will learn to run cheap experiments. If you keep your team small, you should be able to build a proof of concept in less than two months while maintaining a burn rate under 100K USD per month. If your proof of concept is successful, you should launch within six months, and achieve a cost of less than half a million. If you have been successful with one product and are now at the stage of fragmenting the team into 2-3 semi-independent product feature teams, then you should scale accordingly but continue to always have a long term view. 

If you are considering building on a platform that requires you to pay licenses, you should go read my blog post on [Building Bespoke AI Products to Win in the Age of Software](https://blog.dannycastonguay.com/digital%20transformation/building-bespoke-ai-products-to-win-in-the-age-of-software/). 

That doesn’t mean that you should build everything from scratch using free and open-source software. Good candidates for partners are companies that offer a consumption-base API as a service. A few good examples of that would include [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) for payment processing, [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/) for SMS, and [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation) for maps. Favorable reasons to buy these services instead of building them include:

1. They are highly reliable and available
2. They are priced competitively
3. They have very good publicly accessible documentation, which will save your engineer’s time


#3. How can you tell you have reached ASANA?

Yogi masters might tell you that it’s about the journey, not the destination. Meanwhile, mathematicians might tell you that it’s a moving target that you can only reach asymptotically. And Mike Tyson would say that "everybody has a plan until they get punched in the mouth." And there will be a lot of blood, sweet and tears during the journey. 

Regardless of your doctrine, there are a few indicators that you are on the right track. If you can stand up a team in a day, have super-users that recommend your product, have leaders that are actively involved and removing barriers, and are not afraid to take small, calculated risks, then you are well on your way to produce a few unicorns, with enough magic dusts to reward those involved.
