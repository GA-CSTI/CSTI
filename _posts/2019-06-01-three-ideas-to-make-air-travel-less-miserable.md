I consider myself as mindful of the environment in the context of our macro-economy. For instance, I took a number of courses on the topic at MIT with [Jason Jay, Roberto Rigobon, and John Sterman](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/sustainability/team). Yet, in my former job as a consultant, I flew as many miles per year as airline pilots - they can fly a max of 1000 hours per year, and I regularly sat down on airplanes for over 20 hours per week. 

If you can avoid it, please stay home. For less than the price of a place ticket, you can get yourself a great microphone like the [Blue Yeti](https://amzn.to/2WDTtwr) - totally worth the expense so that you are always heard clearly on conference calls. 

In any case, here's three ideas to improve air travel - I know at least one US airline is listening (thanks for the note!).

# 1. In flight app that learns and remembers customer preferences

> Do you want ice in your water?

I think I’ve been asked this question over 500 times, and every time it’s the same answer. Unfortunately, about 10% of the time I don’t get what I asked for. The error is human, but technology could help.

Imagine a small modification to the current app that flight attendants use where they could not only know if the passenger has status on the frequent flyer program, but also what the customer’s past preferences were. For example: meal, drink, and wake up preference.

Yes, this could use machine learning to also estimate what meals and drinks to pack on a plane, but since humans tend to be set in their ways, the last choice (e.g., “water with no ice, warm nuts, and the meat-with-veggie option”) is probably going to get it right 95% of the time. So no machine learning required ;-)


# 2. Airport showers for everyone

> I’m so jet lagged I can’t function today.

You have probably heard this one quite a few times from colleagues and no doubt it is true (and sleep is critically important - no debate there). But sleep deprivation isn’t the only thing affecting your bodies when flying long distances.

Dehydration is a big source of discomfort, not only during flight but for several hours after the flight, sometimes days. While drinking plenty during the flight helps, you can’t possibly drink while sleeping and the skin itself will naturally dry up. Combine that with a flu (especially if your kids just started the school year), and you have yourself and rather unpleasant after-flight experience.

For those who have experienced life with and without it, you know how good it feels to be able to take a warm shower at the airport immediately after a long flight. It makes the cab (or Grab/Uber/Lyft) ride that much more enjoyable, and gives that little jolt of energy to be able to catch on what the world was up to while you were in the air.

But those showers are reserved to the most luxurious lounges, often with long wait times.

Imagine taking a page from the Japanese pod hotels, and creating a bank of showers available to the public.

You could have the reservation app fully revenue-managed with real time spot pricing, and have the doors unlockable by using a smart phone’s NFC. Offer a discount for your own passengers, but also open it to other travelers as a way to get them to install your mobile app.


# 3. Sponsored internet on board

> Sorry I was in flight.

While many people should learn to put down their electronic devices and meditate instead, being connected to the internet while in flight is very valuable.

Unfortunately, except for business travelers, the cost of in-flight internet can be a little steep. And the more users you have, the more scale you will achieve and the cheaper/more reliable it will become for everyone.

You can help solve this chicken or egg problem by taking full advantage of a captive audience which is a marketer’s dream. Here are some concrete ideas of how this could work:

Partner purchase: Make a minimum purchase of $200 on Amazon
