Dear visitor,

Thank you for taking some seconds out of your precious life to visit my website, even accidentally.  

I started this as I wanted to learn more about GitHub pages and Jekyll, hopefully I will publish some blog posts here regarding Data Science, Electric Guitar or Photography related matters. 

I wish you all a Happy New Year! :)

Cheers,  
Nikos
