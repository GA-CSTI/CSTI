One good thing I learned as a mentored consultant is how to give and receive fact-based feedback. Here's a few of the important points:

1. Feedback can be given to anyone (e.g., subordinates, superiors, clients, spouse, parent, children, etc.)
2. Good feedback is given verbally first, and requires cool-headed preparation ahead of time (i.e., write it down)
3. Good feedback is strength-based, fact-based (i.e., truth seeking), and empathetic
4. Receiving good feedback is a gift (i.e., an opportunity to improve)
5. Feedback should be given promptly when urgent, and scheduled regularly otherwise (e.g., 2 weeks)

An effective way to prepare giving someone feedback is to write it down using the following template:

> 1. I have observed _______________.
> 2. It made me feel _______________.
> 3. One idea to improve is _______________.

For example, a real (sanitized) feedback I have given to someone I reported to once was:

> *I have observed that you have selected the most optimistic scenarios to present to the senior client, and have excluded the more conservative ones. I heard you state the importance to show encouraging results, and I too want to build momentum with the client. However, I find this situation uncomfortable for two reasons: 1) the team has used the words "selection bias" and have confidentially voiced concerns about not being fairly represented, 2) I'm afraid that we may condition our client to expect inflated results, and lose their trust a little. One idea to improve this would be to write down on the page that these are the most optimistic scenarios, and add the rest of the scenarios in the appendix.*
