title: Yoga for the Body, Math for the Mind

DRAFT

Yesterday I made a lighthearted observation that I love doing math and yoga daily: yoga is math for my body, and math is yoga for my mind. Let me explain what I mean.

When your body hurts—like your back, knee, or shoulder, it’s often due to repetitive movements that limit your muscles’ full range of motion. Our bodies are designed to move in various and dynamic ways, but many daily activities restrict us to repetitive patterns. Typing, tennis, or even painting can lead to discomfort if they’re the only physical activities we engage in.

Yoga, on the other hand, challenges your body differently. It isn’t just about stretching or flexibility; it’s equally focused on strength and control. When I practice yoga, I try to hold each pose firmly and deliberately, building strength throughout my entire body. Yoga engages almost every muscle, improves balance, and expands the body’s capabilities beyond typical everyday movements.

Handstands are an excellent example. Since nobody naturally walks upside down, practicing handstands requires strength and flexibility in shoulders, wrists, and core muscles, and it challenges your brain to learn new ways of balancing against gravity. This makes yoga an effective way to maintain overall physical health.

However, I don’t mean to suggest yoga is superior to other activities. Tennis, for example, provides great cardio and develops coordination and competitive spirit. Repetition itself can also be valuable, such as finding comfort in routines like prayer, meditation, or any ceremonial practice that brings consistency and peace.

Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu similarly engages the body in diverse and unconventional movements, helping build strength and flexibility safely. Activities like BJJ and yoga demonstrate that moving outside typical patterns promotes long-term physical health and adaptability.

Math, especially when approached creatively through puzzles or math Olympiads, functions similarly for the mind. Many tasks, even creative ones, involve repetitive thought processes. Math challenges the mind uniquely, requiring abstract reasoning and continual problem-solving in new, unexplored ways. While routine mental activities like Sudoku or crossword puzzles have benefits, actively solving diverse and unfamiliar problems stretches your mental capacity further.

Ultimately, I’m advocating for balance. Repetitive activities have their place, offering comfort and deep skill-building. But exploring new movements—physically and mentally—is equally essential. Yoga and creative math are examples of how we can safely and effectively push beyond familiar limits to maintain overall health and mental agility. The key is to engage regularly with both the familiar and the unfamiliar, fostering a balanced approach to physical and intellectual wellness.
